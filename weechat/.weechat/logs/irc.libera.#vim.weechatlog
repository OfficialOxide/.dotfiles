2021-08-25 19:24:27	ncwbqcfe	moldorcoder7: it's not great ux that the file browser (nerdtree) gets clobbered with other buffer operations, in general what you wish is to close a non-file-browser buffer but leave nerdtree intact with same window dimensions etc, avoid it from covering the whole screen.
2021-08-25 19:25:24	moldorcoder7	ncwbqcfe, yes exactly , i will try :b#|bd#

2021-08-25 19:51:23	ncwbqcfe	maybe there's some coc-angular?

2021-08-25 20:13:08	zeraphel	filetypes exist to set filetype specific settings.  That said this 'text.vim' filetype seems very much useless.  create ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/text.vim and set the comment for the filetype there.

2021-08-25 23:47:31	noarb	what's the best way to manually load a vim plugin as a submodule? Most of the git repos are structured so I can just copy the submodule to a directory, e.g. https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround -> ~/.vim/pack/tpope/start/vim-surround
2021-08-25 23:47:59	romainl	well there you have it
2021-08-25 23:48:00	noarb	what about tools like https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline#installation that say "copy all of the files into your ~/.vim directory"
2021-08-25 23:48:38	noarb	is there a way to keep that as a submodule so I can keep up to date in the future? Or do I have to clone the repo and manually link a file, or move it manually?
2021-08-25 23:48:54	romainl	ask on #git
2021-08-25 23:49:02	romainl	or google git submodule
2021-08-25 23:50:01	noarb	it's not a git submodule question. Will vim just load everything under .vim if its vimscript? Does the directory structure matter? The tpope repo uses .vim/pack/tpope/start and mentions something about vim loading tags there.
2021-08-25 23:50:17	romainl	there is no notion of "submodule" in Vim

2021-08-26 00:01:56	romainl	noarb: Vim has something called "runtime" which is structured in a specific way. It has two such "runtimes": a system-wide one that you are not supposed to touch and one in $HOME/.vim/ where you are supposed to do your customisation. Plugins are "mini-runtimes" that follow the same conventions as the canonical "runtimes". You can indeed put all the files and dirs of a plugin directly in $HOME/.vim/ but that will become an unmanageable mess 
2021-08-26 00:01:56	romainl	quickly. Since a couple of versions, you can put all those "mini-runtimes" neatly side-by-side in .vim/pack/ as per the instructions in the help section above.

It was just a joke because I myself would never do that even on feature branches, it's wasteful. The time of commit for me is that time for a little pause and review of what I got, it's different from the time of quick and dirty file save to not lose changes.

2021-08-27 03:31:09	digmbot	:help user-functions -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/eval.txt.html#user-functions
2021-08-27 03:31:58	romainl	sounds like a nice week-end inside
2021-08-27 03:34:03	bn_work	romainl:  what does "complete from existing message" mean?  as mentioned I was hoping to have it "pre-filled" with the previous commit's message that one can easily use as a template and change
2021-08-27 03:34:37	bn_work	although now that I think about it more, I'm not sure how what work as a normal Ex mode command :/
2021-08-27 03:34:48	bn_work	s/what work/that would work/
2021-08-27 03:34:52	romainl	doesn't
2021-08-27 03:35:07	romainl	hence the completion angle

2021-08-27 03:36:06	romainl	it would work as you describe if triggered from a mapping
2021-08-27 03:36:40	bn_work	I know the git commands to grab the last message, check if I'm on the develop branch, etc. just not too sure about the vim function side of stuff 100% (I've done some very primitive functions and am studying existing ones currently)
2021-08-27 03:37:08	bn_work	romainl: is there a built-in example of that which I could study?
2021-08-27 03:37:13	romainl	"save, commit, push" is more of a description of the "how". Expalined in layman terms, what is the high level goal
2021-08-27 03:37:41	romainl	explained*
2021-08-27 03:37:50	romainl	and ?*
2021-08-27 03:38:19	bn_work	what do you mean?
2021-08-27 03:38:43	romainl	I mean "What is the goal?"
2021-08-27 03:39:12	romainl	"I press X and Y happens" is how you imagined it working.

2021-08-27 03:41:24	bn_work	I'm trying to avoid having to have two separate workflows for git and vim.  normally (before this edict came down), I would just hack away code saving as needed and when I'm ready, `git add` or `git add -p ...`, `git commit -m ...` then `git push`
2021-08-27 03:41:36	bn_work	thanks lgc
2021-08-27 03:42:13	romainl	"having my expensive dental procedure financed for me so that I don't sell the car" is the goal. "Sending a letter here, an email there, then waiting and giving some phone calls" is how you reach that goal.
2021-08-27 03:43:00	romainl	so your previous workflow was 100% normal
2021-08-27 03:44:03	romainl	there is nothing to change, there

2021-08-28 01:25:07	lemontree	yes that is included
2021-08-28 01:26:02	lemontree	so basically: so inserting a line break after 80 chars. this is what i want visually, but the line stay one big line in the file

2021-08-28 01:28:13	lemontree	i want it to be wrapped at 80 columns without changing any text
2021-08-28 01:28:24	lopid	is that width less than 80?
2021-08-28 01:28:52	lemontree	no, my screen size/editor size is bigger than 80 columns
2021-08-28 01:30:08	lopid	i am not sure you can wrap at a given length 
2021-08-28 01:30:53	nedbat	lemontree: you have to split the window to get a narrower window if you want it to wrap narrower

2021-08-28 22:39:17	lopid	yes. i was concentrating too much on my chosen method to start again
2021-08-28 22:40:15	lopid	was trying to find a way to have multiple commands in it so i could assign the strlen to a var, and reuse it later

2021-08-29 00:25:13	jaggz	but it'd be good to have one that can handle the capture, and better to have one that let you pick the area.  there's some cli util in linux for mouse-selecting a rectangle
2021-08-29 00:25:27	habamax	where you select either screen/window or a screen rect with mouse

2021-08-29 07:07:02	vvdaiwrw	you need to cut stuff out though, the command will spit font file path, font name and the style

2021-08-29 07:35:51	jaggz	(recently I noticed it hits their server to check for updates)..
2021-08-29 07:36:08	jaggz	new version has that disablable (in debian testing)
2021-08-29 07:36:27	vvdaiwrw	so, did it record just fine then on your side already? did you finish compiling gifski?
2021-08-29 07:36:35	jaggz	no didn't do gifski yet
2021-08-29 07:36:40	vvdaiwrw	k
2021-08-29 07:36:54	jaggz	hmm.. coies to clipboard and .. what else?
2021-08-29 07:36:56	jaggz	copies
2021-08-29 07:37:16	jaggz	(since it was a while ago and I don't know where it went).. I can look more through the code to see what else it does to the file and stuff
2021-08-29 07:37:30	jaggz	oh, and notifies.. I didn't notice a notice
2021-08-29 07:37:58	vvdaiwrw	it only copies url to clipboard if you send it to 0x0
2021-08-29 07:38:02	jaggz	oh shoot.. my draw-border requires itself to stay running .. 
2021-08-29 07:38:16	jaggz	that means I need to background that think and track its pid
2021-08-29 07:38:25	vvdaiwrw	otherwise it's just left in your Videos/ files.
2021-08-29 07:38:38	jaggz	okay cool
2021-08-29 07:38:49	vvdaiwrw	heh, the script has pid tracking already
2021-08-29 07:39:02	vvdaiwrw	you may follow that
2021-08-29 07:39:17	jaggz	nod
2021-08-29 07:40:41	vvdaiwrw	I never upload videos, so the only thing I know works uploading are the gifs, which is the part of the code I've tested iirc.
2021-08-29 07:41:10	vvdaiwrw	I changed something regarding video recording too, but I just never upload it, so can't guarantee.

2021-08-29 08:25:52	vvdaiwrw	np, thx for sharing :)
2021-08-29 08:25:56	jaggz	I added tracking of the pid.. I also changed I .... hey why's it missing line numbers

2021-08-29 08:26:44	jaggz	I also moved the pid info gathering stuff into stop_rec ()
2021-08-29 08:27:00	jaggz	since it had to handle ffmpeg and the border's pids too
2021-08-29 08:27:21	jaggz	I switched them to arrays because we lost the $1 $2 stuff when moving it in there

2021-08-29 08:27:53	vvdaiwrw	okay
2021-08-29 08:27:58	jaggz	I had problems with loading the params that way though, with the newline, so I ended up having to use IFS= stuff to handle it
2021-08-29 08:28:13	jaggz	(I wasn't sure how.. I was using readarray first, with a space delim, and then the newline was captured in the last param)
2021-08-29 08:28:18	jaggz	anyway.. this way works

2021-08-29 16:35:27	joo	can i just bind forward slash to /\c instead of just / ? so it is always case insensitive ?
2021-08-29 16:35:48	joo	i will only rately need case sensitive search and most of the time it is not helpful at all
2021-08-29 16:36:39	habamax	why do you need this?
2021-08-29 16:37:25	habamax	I mean why remap instead of using :h 'ignorecase' ?
2021-08-29 16:37:25	digmbot	:help 'ignorecase' -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/options.txt.html#%27ignorecase%27
2021-08-29 16:37:25	emanuele6	joo: you can simply `:set ignorecase' ,:D

2021-08-31 07:00:43	nova	bfredl, it's an lsp thing. vim has lsp. neovim users in here too. I hadn't received an initial response in neovim.
2021-08-31 07:01:50	nova	one thing vim did better than neovim is terminal bindings. :term in neovim is stupid imo
2021-08-31 07:04:26	vvdaiwrw	that does "vim has lsp" means?

2021-08-31 07:06:19	nova	many vim users use lsp, so maybe one could help. it's okay. no need to spam. I figured it out

2021-09-01 23:04:40	rs_	I asked the following yesterday. Any ideas?
2021-09-01 23:04:45	rs_	I remapped [D to `:<c-u> let g:c=-v:count<CR>:exe c.',.dli <c-r><c-w>'<CR>:exe c.',.dj  <c-r><c-w>'<S-Left><Left>`, which adds support for negative ranges when searching for definitions, but I wanted to show the typed count in the second execution (e.g. after typing 30[D, show `:exe 30.',.dj  M'` instead of `exe c.',.dj  M'`). Is there some way in which I can fix this minor issue?

2021-09-06 17:54:53	m4r35n357	zeraphel, sorry didn't see your reply.  Are you saying you can set function names, to, say green, with the code I pasted?

2021-09-07 22:23:42	habamax	and i suggested bunch of plugins and then asked if c-xc-o was tried
2021-09-07 22:23:44	node1	Maybe it works with only os module. How about with other module?

2021-09-07 22:30:02	vvdaiwrw	and doesn't need vim compiled with +python by the way.
2021-09-07 22:30:20	node1	Also does vim has some hooks? for git for ci/cd kind of work?
2021-09-07 22:30:23	habamax	only node.js is needed :)
2021-09-07 22:30:52	habamax	Friithian: for init.vim there is #theothereditor
2021-09-07 22:31:02	vvdaiwrw	well, they wish vscode-something, so node is a must :)
2021-09-07 22:31:16	habamax	vvdaiwrw: and worth noting too :)
2021-09-07 22:32:07	habamax	but according to the name, node should not be an issue
2021-09-07 22:32:32	node1	Does vim has some github hooks to set CI/CD Pipelines?
2021-09-07 22:32:48	vvdaiwrw	coc.nvim works in vim, you think the n there is due to neovim? nah!
2021-09-07 22:32:48	habamax	node1: btw, vscode is the best if you need smth to work like vscode

2021-09-07 22:33:46	habamax	node1: then why do you want it to be like vs code? ... Don't answer :)
2021-09-07 22:33:46	vvdaiwrw	node1: you won't get it vscode-like then.

2021-09-10 17:40:08	angel99	"sync" with mupdf does not work, so i should try vimtex out 
2021-09-10 17:40:13	vvdaiwrw	vim-latex was a very old and bloated solution iirc, I used it long time ago before vimtex existed.
2021-09-10 17:40:49	angel99	oh i see, then i should definitely switch to vimtex 
2021-09-10 17:41:59	vvdaiwrw	you should take a look at the texlab page to check how your setup may be further improved on top of vimtex, if you want so.

2021-09-16 17:59:39	m4r35n357	it is just the filename
2021-09-16 17:59:52	habamax	it is the list of buffers opened by vim

2021-09-16 18:02:25	m4r35n357	because it contains old code, including a function that is no longer there
2021-09-16 18:02:40	habamax	does it happen with vim -Nu NONE?

2021-09-16 18:05:49	habamax	I mean run vim without any configs/plugins, open a offending file and goto that tag
2021-09-16 18:06:12	habamax	m4r35n357: then smth is wrong with your setup, cause vim has nothing to do with ctags
2021-09-16 18:06:30	habamax	executable, it uses tags file produced by it
2021-09-16 18:06:43	m4r35n357	so, if it is ctags, I can't find any file paths or anything in the tag file
2021-09-16 18:07:05	m4r35n357	if it is git, I would be able to see some (older) commit ID

2021-09-16 18:09:30	romainl	filesystem? git? not Vim anyway so consider asking in relevant channels
2021-09-16 18:10:01	m4r35n357	habamax, yes, I havem seen that, but this is all under source control, there is only one version of the file that I am navigating to

2021-09-16 18:56:04	habamax	tell us
2021-09-16 18:57:45	m4r35n357	file with similar name and similar content (an experiment), not under source control, I saw it in the ctags file, then confirmed in vim
2021-09-16 18:58:01	m4r35n357	I deleted it

2021-09-16 18:58:18	stutz	simiar name..? did you not check the actual filename first?
2021-09-16 18:58:25	stutz	or the path at least
2021-09-16 18:58:26	habamax	we could probably suggest you :tselect tagname
2021-09-16 18:59:15	m4r35n357	stutz, I was asking about how to do that that here at the time . . . 
2021-09-16 18:59:58	m4r35n357	habamax, tselect would have exposed the problem immediately!
2021-09-16 19:00:44	habamax	sorry it has just came onto my mind
2021-09-16 19:01:13	stutz	shame on you, habamax

2021-09-16 19:04:09	stutz	I assume its fair to say that there is not a single person more helpful in the vim community than my l'oeuf romainl, its just the language barrier that sometimes gets in the way
2021-09-16 19:04:30	nedbat	stutz: it is not the language barrier :)

2021-09-16 19:11:32	romainl	just looking at the content of the tags file would have solved the issue
2021-09-16 19:11:51	habamax	m4r35n357: :tselect has just exposed the issue your FS had
2021-09-16 19:12:05	habamax	or ctags working on your FS
2021-09-16 19:12:15	m4r35n357	romainl, over and out, enjoy your on-topic discussions
2021-09-16 19:12:30	habamax	vim patiently did what you have asked it to do -- open first tag under cursor

2021-09-16 19:13:27	romainl	Neither FS nor Git nor ctags nor Vim were at fault, here: every_thing_ was working nominally
2021-09-16 19:16:56	romainl	Over the years, I've found that the inability to locate the boundaries between different systems may be the number one cause of support requests.

2021-09-16 19:19:18	romainl	We assemble many systems into a single black-box-like mental blob and when somethings appears broken we just can't pinpoint the root cause because we have no idea what starts where, what stops where, what interacts with what, etc.

2021-09-17 21:27:00	wwalker	1. What's the official name of the bottom line, where your `:blah` shows up (and file/path/file.c [ReadOnly] shows when you start vim)? 2. is there a way to control how long something sits in there? I know I should learn but when I open in -o or -O mode I always glance down and thinjk that is the file in the buffer in my current window, but it is not.

2021-09-17 21:53:29	wwalker	romainl: Thank you!  I figured it was the "command line" but could only find help on the command-line-window.  
2021-09-17 21:54:49	romainl	it is often spelled :h cmdline

2021-09-17 21:56:40	wwalker	laststatus isn't what I want.  I want all my status lines (I'm usually vertically split, so it is only 1 line).  I want the command line gone.  I found on vi.stackexchange that "set nomodeshow noshowcmd shortmess+=F" should prevent showing anything on the command line, but it doesn't work for me :-(
2021-09-17 21:57:12	romainl	you can't get rid of the command line
2021-09-17 21:57:48	wwalker	the nomodeshow and shortmess+=F work   but noshowcmd still leaves the command there after I hit enter
2021-09-17 21:58:17	romainl	noshowmode is unrelated
2021-09-17 21:58:38	romainl	you want the message or you don't want it?
2021-09-17 21:58:52	wwalker	romainl: yep, same article said it wouldn't go away.  My real goal is solved by shortmess+=F ...
2021-09-17 21:59:14	romainl	which was to not see the message
2021-09-17 21:59:16	wwalker	I would prefer nothing stay in the command line, only what I am typing
2021-09-17 22:00:43	romainl	I don't understand the relationship between the two clauses of that sentence so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2021-09-18 21:54:33	lopid	when closing gvim with a modified buffer around, the yes/no/cancel popup appears. this used to allow pressing "y", "n", and "c" (iirc), but now doesn't. how to change back?
2021-09-18 21:55:42	romainl	wouldn't that be a feature of the graphical toolkit?
2021-09-18 21:56:13	lopid	i don't know if it was vim telling the toolkit what shortcuts to use
2021-09-18 21:56:17	Julian	lopid: does set guioptions+=c change anything
2021-09-18 21:56:28	Julian	(I don't use gvim, but that seems possibly related)
2021-09-18 21:57:07	lopid	with that, the prompt is textual, as per "vim" (not "gvim"), but at least it uses those shortcuts
2021-09-18 21:57:22	Julian	ah I see, you used to have the gui prompt let you use keyboard shortcuts?
2021-09-18 21:57:27	lopid	yes

2021-09-19 17:37:35	xx	how can I make vim correctly recognize that this file has CR line endings https://raw.githubusercontent.com/curl/curl/master/src/macos/src/macos_main.cpp
2021-09-19 17:38:15	xx	vim instead thinks it has UNIX line endings, and displays ^M in the text and shows the entire file as a single line
2021-09-19 17:39:11	xx	it happens even when I start it under vim --clean
2021-09-19 17:39:17	habamax	what is your `set fileformats?`

2021-09-20 21:25:11	cousteau	It was indeed RedHat 7.something

2021-09-20 21:26:17	cousteau	But anyway, the editor SUPPORTS this coloring feature; it's just this v:argv that isn't supported, and I have no idea why 
2021-09-20 21:26:42	romainl	no idea why what?
2021-09-20 21:26:49	Zathrus	cousteau: as romainl noted, v:argv is from 8.1
2021-09-20 21:26:54	romainl	why v:argv is not supported?

2021-09-20 21:34:18	romainl	I wasn't there when the discussion started but I'm sure you were told to check :scriptnames and all, right?
2021-09-20 21:35:03	cousteau	Anyway, setting GIT_EDITOR=vim makes it work for some reason, but GIT_EDITOR=vi (the default) gives me no coloring.  Which is weird, because vi is set as an alias for vim 
2021-09-20 21:35:47	romainl	are you  sure of that?
2021-09-20 21:36:04	←	kerunaru has quit (Ping timeout: 264 seconds)
2021-09-20 21:36:58	cousteau	Yes, I typed `which vi` in both bash and this weird csh thing that comes by default with the machine, and both say that vi is vim 
2021-09-20 21:37:19	moshe	isn't vi an alias for cp and no config or something along those lines ?
2021-09-20 21:39:21	cousteau	It says `alias vi='vim'` when I type `alias` in the command line 
2021-09-20 21:40:07	moshe	:scriptnames and then see if it loads some distro specific stuff
2021-09-20 21:41:19	romainl	$GIT_EDITOR doesn't have a default value IIRC
2021-09-20 21:41:22	cousteau	And if I type `vi .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` it works as expected

2021-09-20 21:43:44	cousteau	OK, I was somehow assuming there wasn't a vi in this machine because any attempt to `which vi` was showing me the alias 
2021-09-20 21:44:41	OMGOMG	don't trust which
2021-09-20 21:45:11	cousteau	Aaand `/usr/bin/which vi` (this one doesn't use aliases) says it's /bin/vi
2021-09-20 21:45:27	romainl	no shit
2021-09-20 21:45:31	cousteau	OK mystery solved I think

2021-09-20 21:49:41	cousteau	 /bin/vi --version says "VIM ... Small version without GUI", and for /bin/vim it says "Huge version without GUI".  Apparently they're different binaries for some reason (both vim, but different compile options)

2021-09-20 21:50:13	romainl	solved indeed
2021-09-20 21:51:01	romainl	but it should have been solved back when I told you about :version, which clearly shows the difference
2021-09-20 21:53:34	cousteau	It clearly shows the difference, but it doesn't show the difference clearly 
2021-09-20 21:54:00	romainl	posting it would have made it clearer

2021-09-20 21:56:51	cousteau	Anyway thanks everybody for the help!

2021-09-20 22:19:57	moshe	romainl: so I stand by what I said earlier, the person who wrote elflord had seriously jacked up terminal colors, and their foreground/white was cyan. In the meantime, here's a screenshot that shows the original gui style, my current 256c hack and the original term version using what gnome-terminal thinks are xterm colors. https://i.ibb.co/jHtjsMT/elflord.png
2021-09-20 22:20:25	moshe	kinda hard to get a feel for what the spirit of the colorscheme is supposed to be when half of it is different :D
2021-09-20 22:23:11	nova	yeah the og colorschemes are borked. hence ability to create own colorscheme
2021-09-20 22:23:16	moshe	there are a few minor atrocities I'll have to settle on a different behaviour for, such as Incsearch which is downright broken in the terminal version of elflord
2021-09-20 22:23:51	←	argento has quit (Quit: leaving)
2021-09-20 22:25:44	romainl	moshe:  your experience pretty much mirrors mine and habamax's with regard to OG colorshemes
2021-09-20 22:26:18	→	sudoforge has joined #vim
2021-09-20 22:27:26	romainl	and IMO "spirit" is more like "author probably wanted a cold colorscheme with high contrast" than "this must blue and that must be dark green"

2021-09-20 22:27:58	moshe	yeah but then if I have to go with what the guy meant, I'm basically recreating the guy version, complete with the cyan normal text

2021-09-20 22:28:10	romainl	so be it

2021-09-20 22:28:18	moshe	OH OK THEN
2021-09-20 22:28:24	moshe	easier that way for me :D

2021-09-20 22:29:13	romainl	GUI gives more freedom for defining the exact color you want with hexadecimal so, when unsure, the most explicit value is the right one
2021-09-20 22:29:49	moshe	the gui colors are standard 256c, or so close it doesn't matter
2021-09-20 22:30:35	romainl	darkcyan is relative and thus unreliable, but #008B8B is absolute and thus reliable
2021-09-20 22:31:03	romainl	and yeah, the closer your GUI are from 256c, the better
2021-09-20 22:32:13	moshe	yeah I'd rather have the experience across all version be consistent, even if that means being slightly ballparkish and turning #aa4444 into $af5f5f

2021-09-23 17:23:11	corgi_boy	sometime I type them by mistake
2021-09-23 17:23:23	corgi_boy	then it becomes really difficult to remove them
2021-09-23 17:23:30	corgi_boy	and indent the code properly
2021-09-23 17:23:46	bfredl	before you know it, your codebase has turned into BASIC
2021-09-23 17:23:50	extern	it's indent/unident automatically
2021-09-23 17:23:50	romainl	so many "competitive programming"-related Vim questions since a few days, what's going on?

2021-09-24 12:27:59	romainl	moshe: good point by habamax, the completion menu should blend more with the colorscheme
2021-09-24 12:28:04	moshe	yeah sure I can do a magenta selection on black I guess
2021-09-24 12:28:15	romainl	or something else
2021-09-24 12:28:54	romainl	reusing the statusline/tabline palette would be a good start
2021-09-24 12:28:55	moshe	ok, slightly darker magenta on dark grey then
2021-09-24 12:29:06	romainl	to have a consistent UI
2021-09-24 12:29:20	moshe	they look just as bad :D
2021-09-24 12:29:28	habamax	whatever you prefer would be better than defaults, and yes it would be nice to be consistent with surrounding colors
2021-09-24 12:30:19	romainl	how about a black on white list with a cyan accent on the scroll bar to fit with the cyan tabline?
2021-09-24 12:30:34	moshe	I don't care ?
2021-09-24 12:31:25	moshe	I mean, I have zero intention of fiddling with colors considering the context is still going to be clown barf
2021-09-24 12:31:53	moshe	so whatever works for you
2021-09-24 12:31:58	romainl	OK, this can be dealt with in a second phase

2021-09-24 12:37:13	moshe	I don't mind doing the initial porting and making a few judgement calls here and there to make both versions more consistent, because it has to be done, but I'm not about to agonize over specific elements like I do or did for my own colorschemes
2021-09-24 12:37:37	romainl	no problem, moshe
2021-09-24 12:38:10	moshe	the  way I see it, some guy who didn't care gave Bram files, Bram waved them in without really  looking at them, no one stepped up to maintain them, and here were are
2021-09-24 12:38:15	romainl	as I said, there will be a "consistency" phase that deals with that kind of granularity

2021-09-24 12:48:49	moshe	when all of  that is done, we're going to have trouble sourcing colorschemes tbh : way too many of the popular ones are gui only with no hope or porting them, and there's way to much 3rd party syntax linking and shuffling  going on under the hood
2021-09-24 12:48:52	romainl	I would like to establish a standard. Cross-platform best practices that authors can follow, or not. One would only have to use colortemplate and follow those best practices to be "includable" 
2021-09-24 12:49:46	habamax	moshe, yep, and as romainl said, there should be a "standard" to be followed
2021-09-24 12:50:03	romainl	if someone can bite the bullet and port gruvbox or whatever to our standard then it will be OK. But the barrier may be high
2021-09-24 12:50:05	moshe	so you guys are probably going to push apprentice, something by habamax, maybe even a couple of my things if you feel like it, because there's virtually nothing popular out there that isn't fucked one way or the other

2021-09-24 13:06:23	habamax	aha
2021-09-24 13:06:51	moshe	I have tweaked it slightly since, and I do have a version that adds colors for diffs and a few other things on my box, but it wouldn't survive a broken environment/terminal, and we all know how we feel about toggles in colorschemes.

2021-09-24 13:07:41	moshe	I could clean them up and toss them in the old issue later today if you want
2021-09-24 13:07:49	habamax	toggles/settings should be discouraged in favor of autocommand way of changing stuff
2021-09-24 13:08:07	habamax	which should be properly described with examples as in romainl gist
2021-09-24 13:08:37	moshe	yeah  but an autocommand isn't going to be able to tell someone's term is broken, or something isn't behaving properly
2021-09-24 13:08:58	habamax	as well as a toggle, right?
2021-09-24 13:09:23	moshe	I well the toggle would have to be triggered by the user at least, but it's still complexity that probably shouldn't be in there
2021-09-24 13:10:04	habamax	an autocommand would also be triggered by the user (by the fact they have included it into their config)

2021-09-24 13:14:25	habamax	I get it

2021-09-24 13:15:27	moshe	I don't mind the idea tho, but that'd expose us and the mailing list to exactly the same issues I'm trying to avoid by making it fg/bg only :D
2021-09-24 13:15:58	habamax	you have a document/help topic, describing how you can tinker your colorscheme with what vim already has

2021-09-24 15:56:49	LordRishav	Vim is able to read the vimrc file, but can't read the runtime directory
2021-09-24 15:57:10	habamax	didn't know vim supports XDS spec
2021-09-24 16:00:00	LordRishav	It is basically a hack, which I got from here https://blog.joren.ga/vim-xdg
2021-09-24 16:02:23	habamax	then probably you should reach the person who did that hack
2021-09-24 16:03:00	LordRishav	It is nothing, just sets the runtimepath value in vimrc

2021-09-24 22:55:45	romainl	Original ron only defines a few GUI colors and essentially falls back to "default" for the rest and for non-GUI scenarios. I was wondering if the approach I validated: taking the GUI colors as a starting point and setting the cterm colors to their rough equivalent was the right one.

2021-09-25 15:19:30	alzgh	hello, how do I do an or in substitute like: `:%s/foo|bar/baz/g`

2021-09-25 15:20:45	c_14	may need to escape the ()s
2021-09-25 15:20:58	alzgh	dammit, should've thought of that :D
2021-09-25 15:20:59	alzgh	thanks
2021-09-25 15:21:01	c_14	depending on your set magic level
2021-09-25 15:21:22	alzgh	how do I check my magic level?
2021-09-25 15:21:39	c_14	:set magic?
2021-09-25 15:21:49	alzgh	OK, thank you
2021-09-25 15:22:08	huf	you can also set it in the regex, just for that regex
2021-09-25 15:22:37	alzgh	what do you mean huf ?

2021-09-25 15:43:48	←	tglman has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2021-09-25 15:43:50	romainl	it's \| not |
2021-09-25 15:44:05	alzgh	this must be it romainl
2021-09-25 15:44:12	alzgh	I only escaped the parens
2021-09-25 15:44:18	alzgh	let me make a quick test
2021-09-25 15:44:38	romainl	you don't need them unless you reuse the match
2021-09-25 15:45:50	alzgh	yes, I needed to escape the pipe, no need to escape parens
2021-09-25 15:46:01	romainl	no need for parens either
2021-09-25 15:46:08	alzgh	damn
2021-09-25 15:46:54	alzgh	what do you mean with you don't need them unlees you reuse the match. do you mean parens are needed if I reference matches by number?
2021-09-25 15:47:05	romainl	yes
2021-09-25 15:47:06	alzgh	because that's what I learned using regex in other places
2021-09-25 15:47:09	alzgh	OK
2021-09-25 15:47:20	alzgh	but pipe needing escaping is weird
2021-09-25 15:47:34	romainl	your problem as you asked it doesn't need parentheses
2021-09-25 15:49:17	alzgh	I'm saying why does pipe need escaping for it to work as `or`?
2021-09-25 15:49:37	alzgh	this is the opposite of what I'm used to
2021-09-25 15:49:50	alzgh	escaping pipes would mean a literal pipe
2021-09-25 15:50:59	romainl	because there are different flavours of regular expressions
2021-09-25 15:51:50	alzgh	is this what the magic level would determine in vim?
2021-09-25 15:52:15	romainl	among other things
2021-09-25 15:52:28	alzgh	OK, I see I have to read a little bit :D
2021-09-25 15:52:31	alzgh	thanks
2021-09-25 15:52:35	romainl	as someone mentioned: :h magic

2021-09-26 16:57:53	moshe	romainl: I talked to a friend who's [insert rarest type of colorblindness] and agrees that as far as catch-all, full-featured solutions go, dichromatic is basically the only way to do it, but I'm wondering if it'd be possible to provide something that would only do minimal highlighting (comments, strings and maybe special) but would take advantage of only having one or two bright colors, not 6 or so fairly

2021-09-26 17:04:15	romainl	normal vision allows for _some_ capacity to distinguish between two close colors because we can use contrast, chroma and so on. colorblind people can't rely on chroma so they have less criterions and distinguishing one color from the other is harder
2021-09-26 17:05:15	romainl	therefore, a colorscheme that works for colorblind people should have fewer, well contrasted colors

2021-09-26 17:15:57	romainl	it is quite relevant as it shows how hard distinguishing the right color is when given too many close colors

2021-09-26 17:16:25	moshe	the ui is hard to wrap your head around, the color recognition part isn't assuming you're not coloblind
2021-09-26 17:16:45	romainl	if Keyword and Whatever only have a couple degrees between them they are harder to differentiate

2021-09-26 17:17:50	moshe	I mean, that's a problem I *also* have with apprentice, to a lesser extent, even with a darker background. I do understand I'm the odd one here, as I even went back to bitmap fonts to get rid of the antialiasing rainbow arterfacts that were also messing up with my perception of colors.
2021-09-26 17:17:52	romainl	that's the core problem with colorblindness: you need more degrees

2021-09-26 17:18:02	moshe	so I figure I'm probably oversensitive in some regard

2021-09-26 17:18:31	→	normen has joined #vim
2021-09-26 17:20:26	romainl	the darkness or lightness of the background has a big effect on how many degrees one needs between two related colors: darker == fewer, lighter == more so we get more creative freedom on a darker background than on a lighter one

2021-09-26 17:23:58	romainl	the light background bleeds into the characters so you need more saturated colors to fight back which are ugly and actually very few
2021-09-26 17:25:30	→	davidfetter_work has joined #vim
2021-09-26 17:26:04	romainl	with a dark background it's the opposite: your characters bleed into the background and you may get a halo that some people can't stand

2021-09-26 17:28:06	moshe	tl;dr : enjoy your lone light background 256c colorscheme that basically just uses the closest approximations of the xterm palette, because that's all you're gonna get.
2021-09-26 17:28:18	romainl	dark-grey-but-not-black bg with slightly muted fg colors hits a sweet spot, creatively speaking but then we loose on the legibility front and we completely loose colorblinds

Could anyone help out what's wrong with the escaped color sequece in the follow line? return l:counts.total == 0 ? "OK" : printf("^[[1;32mW:%d E:%d^[[0m", all_non_errors, all_errors)

2021-09-28 17:59:41	→	pulse has joined #vim
2021-09-28 18:00:40	leduyquang753	It displays color fine for me.
2021-09-28 18:00:50	leduyquang753	Did you try running the program outside of vim?
2021-09-28 18:01:28	And1	leduyquang753: I did not try outside of vim. (Would not know how, to be honest.)
2021-09-28 18:01:51	leduyquang753	Put the print into a standalone program then compile and run it.
2021-09-28 18:02:02	leduyquang753	Just to see if the terminal even supports ANSI escapes.
2021-09-28 18:02:51	And1	leduyquang753: The terminal supports it; using this in other occasions like motd and such, too.
2021-09-28 18:03:07	habamax	and why esc sequences instead of "proper" statusline colors?
2021-09-28 18:03:14	And1	I wonder if there's some other way besides printf to achieve this: https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale#5vii-how-can-i-show-errors-or-warnings-in-my-statusline
2021-09-28 18:03:16	←	romainl has quit (Quit: Leaving.)
2021-09-28 18:03:57	And1	habamax: See link above, I don't think it's possible to add statusline colors to this function?
2021-09-28 18:04:44	habamax	so you want to add it to airline, not to regular statusline?
2021-09-28 18:05:01	habamax	should still be possible
2021-09-28 18:05:35	And1	habamax: Nope, it's a regular statusline.
2021-09-28 18:05:43	habamax	then it is easy
2021-09-28 18:06:10	habamax	if you already do your custom statusline ofc
2021-09-28 18:06:22	And1	habamax: I tried adding color to the following, but I only want errors to be colored, not the 'OK' text, too. set statusline+=\ \|\ %{LinterStatus()}
2021-09-28 18:06:42	And1	habamax: That's why I tried modifying the printf stuff in the else of the function.
2021-09-28 18:07:18	habamax	try simple first, add number 10 to your statusline with different color
2021-09-28 18:08:09	zeraphel	And1: why are you trying to use escape codes rather than highlight groups?
2021-09-28 18:08:38	And1	zeraphel: I don't know how I would.
2021-09-28 18:09:02	zeraphel	:set  statusline=%#Error#hello%#DiffAdd#World

2021-09-28 18:10:00	c_14	And1: the function's just returning a string, just put the colors in that string

2021-09-28 18:12:09	And1	I do use highlight colors already, the thing is that I just want to use the colors for the `else` part. https://paste.debian.net/1213538/
2021-09-28 18:12:57	habamax	why you think you have to use linterstatus() as is?
2021-09-28 18:13:17	habamax	why not create 2 functions?
2021-09-28 18:13:32	habamax	and highlight result of each differently?
2021-09-28 18:14:14	zeraphel	And1: afiak results of function calls from the statusline are not parsed for highlights
2021-09-28 18:14:15	And1	True. Let me wrap my head around this.

2021-09-29 00:11:36	zeraphel	Wulf: plugins are discouraged from adding 'top level' mapping on their own. leader is the compromise. it's a variable so that plugins who supposedly must add mappings, add it under the key you specify. as the enduser, there is no benefit to using <leader> rather than the key you've set it to.

2021-09-29 11:59:57	aplund	If you :edit a file, is nomodifiable meant to be set?
2021-09-29 12:00:23	romainl	automatically?
2021-09-29 12:01:00	aplund	yeah
2021-09-29 12:01:30	romainl	well, in the right conditions, maybe
2021-09-29 12:01:48	romainl	but I would hate it if Vim did that for every file
2021-09-29 12:02:18	aplund	I basically do this: $vim -> (blank buffer with startup stuff) -> :edit file
2021-09-29 12:02:29	aplund	the window has nomodifiable
2021-09-29 12:02:46	iridium__	aplund: why don't you just open the file with `vi <filename>`?
2021-09-29 12:03:16	romainl	^and what file is that? is it in a part of your system that you don't have rights to?
2021-09-29 12:03:46	aplund	iridium__: I'm actually hoping to do many :edit commands, but just an example.
2021-09-29 12:04:04	aplund	file is a regular file in the current working directory which I can read and write.
2021-09-29 12:04:11	iridium__	aplund: i can use `:e` and edit file without any problems.
2021-09-29 12:04:21	romainl	then that nomodifiable is surprising
2021-09-29 12:04:28	iridium__	aplund: do you have this set in your `.vimrc` by mistake?

2021-09-29 12:52:40	romainl	you can open an issue on apprentice's issue tracker

2021-09-29 17:03:57	romainl	the simple fact that the two screenshots in that README are so different shows that the author probably spent more time on the name of their colorscheme than on designing it

2021-10-03 18:46:30	terminerd	Hello, I'm new to here. I don't really get the idea about how to copy things from vim to clipboard
2021-10-03 18:46:31	anchovy	tha- damn.
2021-10-03 18:50:14	ThinkT510	terminerd: first thing you'll want to do is check vim --version to see if your vim package is compiled with clipboard support

2021-10-03 18:54:57	ThinkT510	terminerd: you should get a lot more information than that. it should list all the features included
2021-10-03 18:55:58	terminerd	ThinkT510: Ok, I found -clipboard inside it (but with minus "-")
2021-10-03 18:56:29	ThinkT510	yes, that means no clipboard support, just like mine: https://paste.rs/XcA
2021-10-03 18:56:50	habamax	install gvim
2021-10-03 18:57:26	terminerd	I'm using vim with terminal, so gvim is graphical I guess?
2021-10-03 18:57:34	keir	it also comes with tui vim
2021-10-03 18:57:38	keir	usually
2021-10-03 18:57:52	furrymcgee	see help write_c to copy to external program i.e. xsel, :w !xsel

2021-10-03 18:57:54	keir	but it will be compiled the X11 support
2021-10-03 18:57:54	habamax	:)
2021-10-03 18:58:20	terminerd	Ok, thanks I'll try :)
2021-10-03 18:58:42	habamax	you can also compile it yourself, but installing vim-X11 should be way easier
2021-10-03 18:58:57	habamax	or whatever it is called by redhat

2021-10-03 19:03:17	terminerd	I installed vim-X11 and can run it inside terminal with gvim -v. It can copy to clipboard by selecting the text with the cursor. How can I copy to clipboard with visual mode?
2021-10-03 19:03:35	keir	y

2021-10-05 02:09:50	moshe	I mean, it doesn't make sense. I understand that they'd have to build something on top of pull requests to transform what is inherently an email-based system into something that works with *accounts* but having to play jenga with branches instead of picking isolated commits and pushing these ( give or take obvious reasons such as commits relying on previous commits blablabla)

2021-10-06 21:10:51	hajonnes	jokajak, do you prfere dvorak a lot vs US (if you have tried) on your advantage. I currently use a classic (almost same as advantage but older) with Eurkey (US with european symbols on AltGr)
2021-10-06 21:12:05	hajonnes	why I ask is because I was going alternative layout way but so much is built for qwerty so I let it go.
2021-10-06 21:12:19	→	davidfetter_work has joined #vim
2021-10-06 21:12:33	stutz	why would you even want to switch the layout?

2021-10-06 21:15:15	lmat	hajonnes: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkMB5Q27nQI I think the difference isn't so much speed, but comfort. If you type all day, it can reduce movement and fatigue quite a bit.

2021-10-06 21:29:57	hajonnes	stutz, I find the Eurkey layout to be optimal if I would not switch to dovorak or other non qwerty layout. If you are satified with the layout in Eurkey it I would go for it since it is easy installable and comes pre shipped on most linux distros. Or US international if you like.

2021-10-06 22:23:15	jokajak	I'm planning to get the advantage 360 for a wider shoulder spread. I'm American so I've not had to worry about additional keys so dvorak has been sufficient for me. I'm at break-even speed between dvorak and qwerty so there's not much benefit for me to switch from one to the other except that dvorak should be "better" for my joints long term so
2021-10-06 22:23:16	jokajak	that's what I try to use most of the time. Luckily I'm not switching between systems so I can have them all set to dvorak by default.

2021-10-06 22:36:07	lordvadr	I need some advice. I'm trying to create some functionality and I have no idea what I'm doing. I want to bind a key (I'm using Y for now) to take the current line, run it through some shell commands (`base64 -d` at the moment), open a new window and put the transformed text in it for editing. I sort of accomplished this with a macro but it needs to be cleaner.
2021-10-06 22:37:14	lordvadr	I'm now mapping Y to ":execute B64Edit()" and tinkering with it but it feels like this is the wrong way to do what I'm trying to do.

2021-10-06 23:02:44	lordvadr	Just getting the line the cursor is on moves it to the end of the buffer. When I was "noremap Y :execute YB64ediut()<CR>" it was moving it to the beginning.

2021-10-06 23:04:03	lordvadr	To give you an idea of how misguided I am, this was the original macro: "noremap Y yy:new<CR>^[:setlocal buftype=nofile bufhidden=hide noswapfile<CR>P:%s/.*: //<CR>:%!base64 -d<CR>"

2021-10-07 18:15:05	anchovy	no worries. more questioning cos this is breaking my understanding of it. it looked like nextgroup is a link to the next group of matches that will follow so I built everything around that and (almost) everything works.

2021-10-08 02:06:37	pompez	Hi, I'm trying to write a snippet with UltiSnip which checks if the trigger is preceded by a certain string before expansion. I'm currently readingUltiSnips help page and it mentions the `snip.buffer` being an alias for `vim.current.window.buffer`. What is this buffer object and where could I read and learn about it?

2021-10-08 22:01:55	wwalker	For others, I thought the "set" was implied, but it is implied, but not for parsing.  This line words as expected: "[//]: # ( vim: set shiftwidth=3: )"

I didn't read modeline-version because the first line tells me I don't need it "If the modeline is only to be used for some versions of Vim..."  That is false for me.  I'll open a doc issue and a pull request.  It should also be elevated to a real NOTE:

2021-10-09 01:06:05	nova	(tl;dr if you use CMD={str} .. {str} needs to be ~ \"my string\" or 'my string' because `:help :put` says (paraphrasing) escape | and " to prevent command terminating. Not sure anyone knows why, but it's a thang.)

2021-10-09 01:14:17	stutz	good, so set up phpactor
2021-10-09 01:14:29	echoone	but the project is using an old framework.

2021-10-09 01:17:58	stutz	well then don't
2021-10-09 01:18:20	stutz	point is, php without phpactor and/or LSP is terrible in vim

2021-10-09 01:21:20	echoone	And the messy project that I am dealing with makes it worse
2021-10-09 01:21:45	echoone	I used to work with it in PhpStorm. And even with that it was a pain.
2021-10-09 01:21:58	stutz	well no language can make up for bad code
2021-10-09 01:22:10	stutz	I've seen well written/tested php code and terrible java code
2021-10-09 01:23:02	stutz	but this is not about whether php is good/bad but how to deal with it and all those jump to definitions, refactorings, navigation things cannot be done in a sane way in vanilla vim
2021-10-09 01:23:05	echoone	Some languages are better than others regarding bad code.
2021-10-09 01:23:10	stutz	so either sue the plugins or use phpstorm :)
2021-10-09 01:23:36	echoone	Since PHP lacks some features (like enums), you end up having to do weird stuff to fake them.
2021-10-09 01:23:58	echoone	And the end result is always bad.
2021-10-09 01:24:04	stutz	no you dont, you just use class constants, or a enum lib, or wait 2 more months until enums are released
2021-10-09 01:24:32	stutz	and (despite the lack of them being silly) the enum libs work literally like any enum in any other language
2021-10-09 01:24:35	echoone	class constants are not enums
2021-10-09 01:25:07	stutz	I am not arguing php here, move that to ##php. I was trying to help you figure out how to make vim work nicely with it
2021-10-09 01:25:16	stutz	if that help ain't needed I am out again
2021-10-09 01:25:40	echoone	No worries. I appreciate the help.

2021-10-14 14:08:02	RoyK	hi all. wee question: I'm editing a python file and I have this modeline 'vim:ts=4:sw=4:sts=4:et:ai' - after typing somevar = { and pressing <enter>, it gives me *two* indents, not one. Any idea why?
2021-10-14 14:10:03	lopid	eight spaces in?
2021-10-14 14:10:49	lopid	freom the brace, rather
2021-10-14 14:11:34	←	Chanakan5591 has quit (Quit: Goodbye, Have a good day/night! :D)
2021-10-14 14:11:54	lopid	ok then
2021-10-14 14:13:08	mgedmin	doesn't do that for me, but I've a bunch of plugins and plausibly one of them overrides the python indentexpr
2021-10-14 14:13:43	mgedmin	or maybe the indentexpr sees something on an earlier line that makes it think the somevar = line should be indented more, and then it adjusts the new line according to that?
2021-10-14 14:13:55	mgedmin	does this happen if you put somevar = { at the very top of the file?
2021-10-14 14:14:16	RoyK	lopid: I turned off expandtab and it gave me two tabs
2021-10-14 14:15:25	mgedmin	could be a just a stylistic choice of the author of the python indent plugin
2021-10-14 14:15:29	mgedmin	maybe it's even configurable somewhere
2021-10-14 14:15:55	mgedmin	I see I use a plugin: Vimjas/vim-python-pep8-indent

2021-10-17 19:17:59	tane	Howdy! I have a normal-mode mapping that inserts an imcomplete command in the bar at the bottom like ":Foo " that I can then complete to ":Foo bar1 bar2" and hit enter. I'd now like to make another mapping that inserts the date but still allows me to complete the text afterwards, e.g. executing the mapping should result in ":Foo 2021-10-17 " in the bar at the bottom, which I can then complete to ":Foo 2021-10-17 bar1 bar2". How 
2021-10-17 19:17:59	tane	do I do that?

2021-10-17 19:18:50	tane	I do know about strftime, but I cannot manage to actually insert its result into the bar without executing the whole thing
2021-10-17 19:18:57	habamax	what is your current mapping?
2021-10-17 19:19:21	tane	au FileType vimwiki nnoremap <localleader>zn :ZettelNew<space>
2021-10-17 19:20:32	tane	this gives me ":ZettelNew ", now I'd like a mapping like <localleader>znb that gives me ":ZettelNew Sitzung - 2021-10-17 - "

2021-10-17 19:22:31	tane	does <C-R>=funcall(..)<CR> execute it?

2021-10-26 20:35:02	arseru	Hi everyone, how can I avoid having files ending with `~` when I edit them in vim? I've been having them since last 2 weeks or so
2021-10-26 20:35:28	romainl	well, how do you create them?
2021-10-26 20:36:14	arseru	romainl: I just create a new file `tmp` with vim, add contents to it, then save and quit and open it again, write some more, and then a `tmp~` file appears with only the contents of the first edit I wrote

2021-10-26 20:39:57	romainl	it's oooooold
2021-10-26 20:44:17	arseru	well, it seems I added a while back this chunk to my vimrc https://bpa.st/AS5Q which seems to be doing that backup :P

2021-10-27 18:06:31	Suvalis	Naan: don't feel bad. It's taken me YEARS to finally get around to learning Vim. It's like learning the piano, you have to force your way to use it even though like skiing the first time it's fustrating as heck until you are semi-proficient, then you start to understand why it's great. ;)
2021-10-27 18:07:05	Naan	I didn't even know aw was a thing wow !
2021-10-27 18:08:23	Naan	Suvalis, yeah I think I'm in danger of stagnating though I have got to a level where I've been comfortable using it for months now but I am probably missing a lot of cool stuff from my vim armory
2021-10-27 18:08:35	Suvalis	I was just looking at efficient ways to delete/change everything between white space when my cursor was on the last character in normal mode. I was using ciW but caW is good too
2021-10-27 18:08:51	lopid	diW
2021-10-27 18:10:38	Naan	like if I had to list the things I use regularly: c, d, x, G, gg, y, p, o, visual blocks, vim-surround, ctrl-V w, :s 
2021-10-27 18:10:39	Suvalis	Lopid: I see what you mean about the whitespace with a vs i
2021-10-27 18:11:17	Naan	uh I guess sometimes % too and t  
2021-10-27 18:11:59	Naan	I guess just the basics ! 
2021-10-27 18:12:04	Suvalis	What would really help my proficiency is if I could use vim in all my apps. Textual on the Mac "kinda" allows that, but there are too many differences that would screw my brain mapping up switching between real vim and textual key mappings.

2021-10-27 18:16:03	Suvalis	Also, with vim it's easy if you don't know how to do things to slip into just doing something less efficient like hitting d a bunch of times to delete a word, but you need to STOP yourself and say "NO, I WILL look at the docs and figure out the proper way to do this without being lazy". ;)

2021-11-01 18:30:04	romainl	I have an experimental custom colorscheme in progress with cursorline set to fg+underline, meaning that the syntax highlighting is gone for the current line. Will see if it works in practice.

2021-11-01 21:41:04	aphysically	vim is actually specifically called out in the paper as being vulnerable
2021-11-01 21:41:36	aphysically	(to the homoglyph attack), so a plugin that highlights characters that are confusables using the unicode algorithm would solve it
2021-11-01 21:42:24	aphysically	it would only need to work on identifiers if we know what those are, but yeah it could be a fun plugin learning project maybe?

2021-11-01 21:46:15	DixieFlatline	I don't know anyone who uses Bibi in UTF or RTL stuff, the homoglyph thing seems trickier...  maybe a plugin that looks for multibyte characters as apart of a list or "kind of" regex settable as a variable?

2021-11-01 22:12:49	moshe	yeah it's stock 8.0 with a handful of cherrypicked patches, so my guess is you're missing actual features

2021-11-01 22:14:25	DixieFlatline	it says 8.0; I'm curious at the code that generates these little sub-menus and the controls... depending on how annoyingly this plugin is written (I was working on something similar with gvim balloon popups)... the ability to have terminal balloon / menu / popup and the top menu elements are really nifty
2021-11-01 22:15:05	DixieFlatline	I'm going to try the plugin on an 8.2 on desktop
2021-11-01 22:16:32	moshe	the toolbar thing requires  8.0.1123 according to the colortemplate doc

I often alphabetise these; select the lines and use Vim's sort. But! then the trailing commas are off, and I have to fix it by hand. Can anyone recommend a better way?

2021-11-12 14:52:19	herjazz	howdo all. I've set up vim to launch a linter for python files on save. However, I've noticed it seems to always be linting the save before last, rather than the current state of the file. Probably something obvious but how can I make it lint the current state?
2021-11-12 14:53:01	osse	sounds like the linter reads the file from disk and not the current buffer contents
2021-11-12 14:53:12	herjazz	yeah I'm guessing as much

2021-11-12 17:46:16	romainl	either you run your linter on a file, which means that the right event is BufWritePost, or you run run it on stdin, which means that the right event is BufWritePre.

2021-11-12 20:25:24	puremourning	so what vim does is that it stores the textprop_Ts at the end of the data for each line
2021-11-12 20:26:06	puremourning	so the line is like a null terminated string, followed by a (possibly empty) array of textprop_T (which might not be aligned!)

2021-11-12 20:35:32	puremourning	but it would be more efficient to walk the buffer in c rather than in vimscript land

2021-11-12 22:57:59	m_ben	bfredl: has anyone done any benchmarks on vim's text-props vs neovim's extended marks. would be interesting to see which one performs better. one problem I encountered with text-properties is that the buffer needs to be loaded. if you have a larger list of locations for multiple files, you need to either load all files, or set up a BufRead autocmd and call prop_add() after the buffer is loaded by the
2021-11-12 22:58:01	m_ben	user. this problem does not occur when it's stored separately (which is also done for signs)
2021-11-12 22:58:35	m_ben	but iirc Bram said (somewhere) that storing text-properties with the text is more efficient

2021-11-12 23:04:50	bfredl	<m_ben> "bfredl: has anyone done any..." <- not really. I assume vim:s text props have more cache coherent access, but neovim's extmarks should be easier to manipulate as you don't need to shuffle around actual buffer text to make space for it.

2021-11-21 00:47:32	dangeroo	anyone know of a half-decent compiler plugin for cmake? i.e. runs cmake --build ....; i could write one of course, but be nice if someone knows a good one. THings like :CMakeBuild need not apply
2021-11-21 00:48:29	dangeroo	actually, i think i know the answer. i'll just set makeprg myself
2021-11-21 00:49:00	jdavfsxd	kind of thing that never felt worth looking for for me, despite my ~130 plugins.

2021-11-21 00:53:22	dangeroo	i'd consider writing a cmake compiler plugin and contributing it to vim and maintaining it forever, except for one important issue
2021-11-21 00:53:35	dangeroo	that would encourage people to use cmake, and i simply cannot be involved in that

2021-11-21 00:54:46	dangeroo	jdavfsxd: assuming you mean vim-cmake then see the part of my message that said ":CMakeBuild need not apply"; it's not a compiler plugin, it doens't set makeprg https://github.com/cdelledonne/vim-cmake/search?q=makeprg i.e. it is fail :/
2021-11-21 00:54:57	dangeroo	well paying homage to YCM is obviously a bonus

2021-11-21 00:56:59	jdavfsxd	possibly it just refers dislike setting makeprg, but their solution evades it completely then.

2021-11-21 01:01:20	bfredl	well, cmake generates a makefile (or build.ninja file) for you, then you just invoke `:make` with make (or ninja) as makeprg.

2021-11-24 20:53:15	lopid	which one?
2021-11-24 20:53:33	imakestuff	if i do search it lets me go back to the cursor which makes sense 
2021-11-24 20:53:45	imakestuff	but doing it again takes me to the beginning of the file 
2021-11-24 20:54:44	imakestuff	i have no idea how the jump points are defined
2021-11-24 20:55:09	lopid	beginning of the file is probably from when you first opened it
2021-11-24 20:55:27	romainl	entries in the jump list are the cursor position before jump motions

2021-11-24 20:55:47	lopid	if it helps, :jumps shows you all the locations. it might also confuse you at this stage
2021-11-24 20:56:08	romainl	the current  position is recorded in the jump list when you jump

2021-11-24 20:57:48	romainl	note the last few words: "and the commands that start editing a new file"
2021-11-24 20:58:10	imakestuff	i see that / is a jump comand 
2021-11-24 20:58:16	imakestuff	so i did a search using / 
2021-11-24 20:58:20	imakestuff	then C-o
2021-11-24 20:58:22	imakestuff	takes me back 
2021-11-24 20:58:26	romainl	yes
2021-11-24 20:58:38	imakestuff	when I do C-I I expect to go back to the search destination, am i right? 
2021-11-24 20:58:49	romainl	you are wrong
2021-11-24 20:59:30	romainl	as I said earlier, what is recorded in the jump list is the cursor position before a jump
2021-11-24 21:00:00	imakestuff	romainl: actually i tried it now and it worked!
2021-11-24 21:00:12	imakestuff	i think after search doing C-o records it 
2021-11-24 21:00:49	romainl	so if you moved the cursor after your latest jump and you do <C-o>, then <C-i> will move you back to where the cursor was, not to the search match
2021-11-24 21:02:32	imakestuff	okay got you 
2021-11-24 21:02:39	romainl	you are moving up and down a list that is updated constantly so you shouldn't assume that <C-i> will move you back to your last search match
2021-11-24 21:04:00	romainl	if you mainly use jump motions then it will become natural quickly. If you don't it will be a lot slower and less useful.

2021-11-24 22:20:16	sylario	WSLg is part of WSL

2021-11-24 22:23:49	puremouron	there's a command in vim now to re-connect the xserver connection if it dies
2021-11-24 22:23:51	puremouron	it's relatively new

2022-03-25 20:06:47	nova	indubitably, but why? Seems weird to me. eg: for maps order doesn't matter. I guess for syntax, it's being generated in real time and maps are only evaluated upon key press that matches map LHS

2022-04-16 17:58:16	sgon	lopid: thank you very much! it works.
2022-04-16 17:58:35	sgon	I remembered it was the default behavior. Now, it's not.
2022-04-16 17:58:44	habamax	never was
2022-04-16 17:58:59	habamax	at least not since 6.4
2022-04-16 17:59:22	→	tedwing has joined #vim
2022-04-16 18:00:02	sgon	It was in the old days. It's like more than 13 years ago. or maybe 15 years ago. I can't remember the exact number.
2022-04-16 18:02:25	habamax	well 6.4 is about that time
2022-04-16 18:02:44	habamax	or even earlier
2022-04-16 18:03:11	habamax	I started vimming in ~2002
2022-04-16 18:03:52	habamax	on windows, so my memory tells me there were never mswin sourced by default
2022-04-16 18:04:45	sgon	I am not a vim expert. Just use vim for some fast edit. Thanks for the help and info.
2022-04-16 18:05:33	joo-_	maybe you need to hold down shift or something, and i think its ctrl-shift-v to paste, or mouse3
2022-04-16 18:05:53	habamax	joo-_: that is windows, and most probably gvim, so nope
2022-04-16 18:05:54	joo-_	if you right click left hand corner i think there is some settings
2022-04-16 18:06:09	joo-_	ah i thought it was the windows terminal application
2022-04-16 18:08:40	sgon	lopid's solution works very well. Simply `source $VIMRUNTIME/mswin.vim`. Both vim and gvim work in windows 11.

2022-04-17 18:11:03	burak	Hi vim users, I've strange issue with vim syntax highlighting. I edited the file with vim and exited. There is no syntax highlighting issue while editing the file.
2022-04-17 18:11:34	burak	When I open the file again, vim automatically jumps the page line according to last line that i edited just before. At this time, the syntax highlighting is broken.
2022-04-17 18:11:47	burak	Strange issue that when I navigate the file with pageup down keys, the syntax is corrected automatically. How can i deal with?
2022-04-17 18:15:57	igemnace	burak: is this a large file? vim only goes back a certain number of lines to establish context for syntax highlighting, so if e.g. you jump into the middle of the file and there's a sizeable comment or string block that starts more than a few lines up (don't remember the option or the default value), syntax highlighting can get thrown off
2022-04-17 18:16:04	igemnace	i've forgotten the option governing this...

2022-04-17 18:21:36	igemnace	oh, it's because it's not an option, but a convention among syntax files. :helpgrep c_minlines
2022-04-17 18:22:45	igemnace	burak: if so, try reading :helpgrep sh_minlines
2022-04-17 18:23:07	igemnace	(or perhaps the equivalent, if .ebuild uses a different syntax file)
2022-04-17 18:25:31	burak	igemnace: oh, adding let sh_minlines = 100 into the .vimrc file solves my problem. thanks!

2022-04-17 19:04:17	burak	Another syntax highlighting issue is that, vim does not recognize syntax of bash parameter transformation expression only and only if ${parameter@operator} is used. https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html . An example, https://dpaste.com/CUV2RZHCD.txt  vim shows the @Q part on the line 6 and 8 as a invalid syntax, however it is true. It looks like, those @Q
2022-04-17 19:04:18	burak	part is painted red. Any ideas?

2022-04-20 08:52:46	jensen	i'm thinking of binding either ctrl-j/k or alt-j/k to move up/down lists in general (completions, selecting files, etc.) that is normally bound to ctrl-p/n and use the other ctrl-h/j/k/l or alt-h/j/k/l for window movements. is there any particular preferences such as common conventions by plugins or using vim in a terminal that might make one choice better than the other?
2022-04-20 08:54:12	nickspoon	alt mappings in general can be problematic, they are not always handled well by terminals or vim
2022-04-20 08:54:31	nickspoon	But if they work for you, I don't see any reason to prefer one or the other

2022-04-21 13:28:02	LACampbell	so my vim is in monochrome. how would I go about debugging this? a colorscheme has been set, and this
2022-04-21 13:28:04	LACampbell	same vimrc displayed colors in another terminal
2022-04-21 13:29:21	osse	LACampbell: echo $TERM
2022-04-21 13:29:38	LACampbell	osse: alacritty
2022-04-21 13:29:55	LACampbell	is there a documented list of what $TERM vars work?
2022-04-21 13:30:14	osse	if you run vim like this, do you get colors?  TERM=xterm vim
2022-04-21 13:30:34	LACampbell	I do
2022-04-21 13:31:21	osse	Do you get colors if you run  vim -u NONE ? (the ~ and <Enter> etc. should be colored)
2022-04-21 13:31:42	LACampbell	yeap, white and blue
2022-04-21 13:32:12	osse	In that case it's your colorscheme that checks $TERM for some reason and it doesn't like alacritty
2022-04-21 13:32:40	Harzilein	LACampbell: those are only keys in a terminal database. it's not necessarily a fixed list to document. they do have descriptrive strings
2022-04-21 13:32:43	osse	TERM is supposed to be set by the terminal itself, and alacritty is likely the correct value.
2022-04-21 13:32:44	LACampbell	oh yeah. probably that vintage colorscheme pack I use... from back in the good old days when people actually used contrast
2022-04-21 13:33:03	LACampbell	so let me try with good old elflord

2022-04-21 13:37:41	LACampbell	if there's nothing obvious from a vim perspective, might try raising an issue with alacritty
2022-04-21 13:37:43	LACampbell	yeah official repo
2022-04-21 13:37:54	LACampbell	all pretty vanilla
2022-04-21 13:38:16	LACampbell	faking the term as XTERM seems to work, maybe that's a fix

2022-04-21 16:14:26	nova	mkkjdv, :set backup? backupdir?  if you don't set backup in your vimrc, probably not.

2022-04-21 16:19:58	nova	if you delete more stuff, it moves down the numbered registers, so "1p or "2p or "3p ... etc will paste it back
2022-04-21 16:20:31	mkkjdv	exactly. That's what I wanter to recall. I knew it's possible

2022-04-22 01:39:21	SenoraRaton	Is there a way from a bash script to open Vim and execute :PlugInstall?  I'm writing an import script for my dotfile repo, and I want it to setup my vim environment completly. I also think I need to run PlugInstall before I run the YCM install script.
2022-04-22 01:40:13	puremourning	You can run vim commands from command line with -c
2022-04-22 01:40:33	puremourning	Eg vim -c PluginInstall -c qa
2022-04-22 01:40:45	nedbat	Intelo: my feeling is that you can get 98% of the behavior you need with simple searching.  Why are backlinks better than hashtags, for example?

2022-04-22 14:52:03	Payam	I want to add text to the end of each line.
2022-04-22 14:52:29	Payam	I can do ctrl+v and press I to change the begiining
2022-04-22 14:52:34	Payam	but how about the end

2022-04-22 15:00:45	→	BluesBoy has joined #vim
2022-04-22 15:02:15	zutt	another popular way seems to be: selecting lines -> :%norm A<texthere>
2022-04-22 15:02:48	zutt	but I think this ctrl-v -> $ -> A is more intuitive if you're used to ctrl+v -> I? one more step to remember tho

2022-04-22 20:30:30	rexkerr	I am trying to write a vimscript function that needs to locate a C++ lambda.  I'm trying to use search().  No matter how I try to include a literal [ (opening square bracket) in my regex it always fails to find anything.  The same exact regex works when using / and ?.
2022-04-22 20:30:31	rexkerr	With this text file:
2022-04-22 20:30:32	rexkerr	     auto var = []() {
2022-04-22 20:30:32	rexkerr	     };
2022-04-22 20:30:32	rexkerr	And a simplified search of:
2022-04-22 20:30:33	rexkerr	    let linenum = search("^\s*auto.*=\s*\[", "bW")
2022-04-22 20:30:33	rexkerr	(with &magic set to 1)
2022-04-22 20:30:34	rexkerr	It will not find the regex, no matter what, but if I remove the \[ the search finds the line.
2022-04-22 20:30:34	rexkerr	Help would be appreciated! Thanks!

2022-04-22 20:37:31	romainl	basically, your pattern works as-is with single quotes and needs some more backslashes with double quotes
2022-04-22 20:38:09	rexkerr	Thanks.  That probably explains a number of other problems that I've had in the past.

2022-04-23 17:04:39	romainl	There are three types of uses for Vim, really. #1 is "I don't want to use it" so you basically only need to know how to exit it. #2 is "I use it for quick simple edits" for which everything you need is taught in vimtutor. And then there is #3, which is "I'm using it as my main driver for long sessions of programming and stuff" for  which one _needs_ to go well beyond the basics if one wants to rip the benefits of chosing Vim to begin with.

2022-04-23 20:49:17	Intelo	zeraphel well how to simply create the wiki in the folder in which vim was started? no need for .git detection for now. How to simply do that?
2022-04-23 20:53:27	zeraphel	Intelo: edit a file that's matched by `*vimwiki-register-extension*` as the doc i sent earlier describes,  If the path is outside of those defined in g:vimwiki_list a temporary wiki will be created.

2022-04-23 22:04:03	habamax	I guess {} are defined as region in json syntax file
2022-04-23 22:04:53	habamax	what you can try to figure out if this is the issue, try command :syntax sync fromstart
2022-04-23 22:05:22	phyto	ohh, that makes a lot of sense. now i see the pattern of which ones are missing, it's just those with a matching brace offscreen.
2022-04-23 22:05:54	phyto	and it looks as though that command fixed it! thanks habamax, would this be a safe thing to put as a json autocmd?
2022-04-23 22:06:04	habamax	you can also try :syntax sync minlines=100

2022-04-23 23:27:31	Intelo	thanks! it seems you 'do' use vimwiki youself? in that case, I have a question: do you use 'vim-markdown'? https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown  and what do you use for live preview?
2022-04-23 23:29:41	Intelo	zeraphel ^
2022-04-23 23:31:59	zeraphel	I do use it, But it's more of a matter of old habbits. I don't use vim-markdown as most of my wikis were not written in it.  Mostly just use vimwiki for per-project timelines (diaries) and cross referencing..
2022-04-23 23:33:28	zeraphel	Intelo: as for live preview,  I had experimented several times scripting wrappers around pandoc & zathura but i haven't kept any of them..
2022-04-23 23:33:55	zeraphel	actually IIRC zathura comes with auto-reload OOTB...

2022-04-24 22:00:30	zhme	hello
2022-04-24 22:00:58	zhme	I have been having a bug where when issuing sudo to open vim every # sign is highlighted obnoxiously, is this because of my config?
2022-04-24 22:01:44	romainl	"highlighted obnoxiously"?
2022-04-24 22:02:39	zhme	yea, under normal user priv vim displays everything in the same color - but when using sudo the background is yellow and negative looking
2022-04-24 22:02:46	romainl	also, use sudo -e/sudo -E or sudoedit
2022-04-24 22:02:48	zhme	only on # signs
2022-04-24 22:02:57	zhme	instead of sudo ?
2022-04-24 22:03:02	romainl	yes
2022-04-24 22:03:05	zhme	hmm one sec
2022-04-24 22:03:47	romainl	now the question: will they just try it right away or will they do $ man sudo?

At least he had all the obligatory stickers to attest to his street cred. I watched him working his magic for a solid 15 minutes and all he did was switching from one space to another and, when in a terminal, cd-ing and ls-ing.

2022-04-26 14:17:14	rs_	the input should have been sorted beforehand for this type of operation (similar to `uniq -u`)
2022-04-26 14:17:26	igemnace	that's uniq -u

2022-04-26 14:18:26	igemnace	this is why it is important to have the problem described in natural language, though, because we're inferring from an attempted solution that may not actually correspond with the goal

2022-04-29 20:17:31	nova	grondilu: it's a handy thingy. the one thing I will say is that when you start using ctrl-w a lot, it can be harmful in a web browser. ctrl-w universally closes a tab in web browsers like chrome, firefox, opera. since control+backspace is typically used to delete back a word, you may want to add inoremap <c-bs> <c-w> to your vimrc if your brain is not good at context switching
2022-04-29 20:20:21	grondilu	I think almost anywhere the shortcut to erase the last word is Alt-Backspace
2022-04-29 20:21:08	grondilu	or Ctrl-backspace, can't recall

2022-04-29 20:29:31	nova	grondilu: <c-bs> is ctrl-backspace. If you're not in gvim or macvim or whatever, <c-bs> may not work if you changed $TERM (or tmux/screen did). You can also try <m-bs> or <a-bs> for alt-backspace instead if you're on mac, but I think that has less of a chance of working
2022-04-29 20:31:06	nova	well huh. yeah. <c-bs> doesn't work for me in WSL, for example - only in gvim.exe. *shrug*

2022-04-30 16:00:32	romainl	"repeatable"?
2022-04-30 16:01:02	oxide	i.e. i can do j. to do it on the line below it
2022-04-30 16:01:53	romainl	there is no "remove the first non-space character from a line" edit command so you have to do it with a motion to that character, which means it can't be repeated
2022-04-30 16:02:22	oxide	so it can only be done with a macro

2022-04-30 22:44:38	romainl	The core issue is that a buffer and its associated file can't be expected to have the exact same content and all the SO answers are written assuming buffer === file.

2022-04-30 22:47:58	romainl	Nothing in Vim exists to address that issue easily and the users themselves are also rarely aware of the distinction anyway so the question pops up regularly, with always the same confusion and compromises.

2022-05-01 20:03:40	japh	vim-plug; I'm trying to load a different version of the same plugins depending on if I'm working on them or not. I'm thinking this could would suffice, but even though the conditionals fall through I get the normal behaviour (what's in the else-clause). Am I missing something regarding vim-plug behaviour?

2022-05-01 20:55:32	romainl	there  are several parts to what you are asking
2022-05-01 20:56:42	romainl	IIRC :[range]execute was added recently but that only deals with one part of the problem
2022-05-01 20:57:28	japh	hey, nice
2022-05-01 20:57:42	romainl	for the other part, well your lines of viml would need to end with a :cexpr
2022-05-01 20:57:44	japh	works for a single line so far

2022-05-01 20:58:45	romainl	what code do you have in those lines?
2022-05-01 21:00:00	japh	well, it'll obviously be different each time, but a simple example;
2022-05-01 21:00:01	japh	    let in_visual = get(a:options, 'visual', 0)
2022-05-01 21:00:01	japh	    let start_line = in_visual ? getpos("'<'")[1] : 1
2022-05-01 21:00:01	japh	    let end_line   = in_visual ? getpos("'>'")[1] : line('$')
2022-05-01 21:00:45	japh	mostly for inspecting that things are what I expect them to be while coding
2022-05-01 21:02:09	romainl	I only do nnoremap <key> :silent %y\|@"<CR>
2022-05-01 21:04:10	romainl	I'm afraid the nature and history of vimscript makes it impossible to provide a general answer to your question
2022-05-01 21:05:07	romainl	maybe vim9script will make it better thanks to compilation ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

2022-05-02 00:28:49	tmx	like not gui
2022-05-02 00:28:55	romainl	tui
2022-05-02 00:29:00	tmx	yes
2022-05-02 00:29:15	romainl	well, it's the same mechanism in both cases anyway
2022-05-02 00:29:46	tmx	can you share some light on it
2022-05-02 00:29:59	romainl	"shed"
2022-05-02 00:30:28	romainl	that gist tells you how to override your colorscheme's colors if that's what you want: https://gist.github.com/romainl/379904f91fa40533175dfaec4c833f2f

2022-05-02 00:37:42	romainl	won't really help you, though
2022-05-02 00:39:51	tmx	yeh where is the source file for those settings anyway
2022-05-02 00:40:47	tmx	since there is highlighting
2022-05-02 00:41:00	romainl	you can find the syntax script for cpp at $VIMRUNTIME/syntax/cpp.vim

I have created a colors directory inside of .vim and curled the gruvbox.vim file into it but when I select it with :colorscheme gruvbox it looks nothing like it? It is a pale yellow background with the wrong syntax highlighting

2022-05-06 22:35:18	aeurraa	The default is the vim default or your terminal default?

2022-05-06 22:36:28	aeurraa	Does default vim look the same on everyone's machine or it uses the color of your terminal?
2022-05-06 22:36:29	romainl	:colorscheme default is Vim's default colorscheme but it uses the terminal palette so by changing the terminal palette you can get a somewhat nicer default Vim colorscheme
2022-05-06 22:36:51	aeurraa	I see
2022-05-06 22:37:28	romainl	terminals have different default palettes so yeah, Alice's default may not be Bob's

2022-05-06 23:43:05	amaurea	On one of the computers I'm using, the vim syntax highlighting colors start out being the ones I want (e.g. green comments), but then after a fraction of a second switch to a different theme (cyan comments). This is for vim 7.4 (yes old) running in the terminal over ssh.
2022-05-06 23:43:34	amaurea	I've tried to track down what's causing this so that I can stop it, but I haven't had any luck so far
2022-05-06 23:43:38	amaurea	Any ideas?
2022-05-06 23:45:46	→	jstein has joined #vim
2022-05-06 23:49:09	amaurea	Looks like it's affected by "set nocompatible" that I have in my vimrc. If I remove that, then the color flash disappears, and I instead get a third color scheme that's different from both the others

2022-05-07 00:00:05	amaurea	Hm, looks like nocompatible should be unnecessary in a vimrc: "When a |vimrc| or |gvimrc| file is found while Vim is starting up, this option is switched off"

2022-05-07 00:21:11	romainl	try :set bg=dark in your vimrc
2022-05-07 00:21:31	amaurea	the plugin issue you linked to sounds similar, but my stuff happens even if I override all vimrc files with one that only contains "nocompatible" and "syntax on". That won't load any plugins, will it?
2022-05-07 00:21:34	romainl	also :set bg=light

2022-05-07 00:22:25	romainl	looks like bg being set belatedly to me
2022-05-07 00:23:09	amaurea	wow, that's it!

2022-05-07 00:43:07	hightower4	Hey two questions: (1) what's the key binding to search a word under cursor in forward way (opposite of # which searches backwards), and (2) is there a key binding to put word under cursor in default paste buffer (like 'y', but without having to select it)?

2022-05-07 21:34:54	nahcetan	with getting the path into a register or getting TextYankPost to trigger?
2022-05-07 21:35:13	romainl	former first :-)
2022-05-07 21:36:16	nahcetan	drop the path into an debugger script "breakpoint set --file <path goes here> --line 99"
2022-05-07 21:36:41	nahcetan	and also, use it in notes to link to other files

2022-05-07 21:39:04	nahcetan	as for TextYankPost, i have a couple of autocmds setup for it.  (they invoke some scripts that yank into a tmux buffer / yank into the pasteboard of the machine from which i'm ssh'd in to the host running vim)
2022-05-07 21:39:37	→	llorllale has joined #vim
2022-05-07 21:39:40	romainl	why the many registers?
2022-05-07 21:41:38	nahcetan	just feels broken without it.  until yesterday, i just had it setup to yank into one register and invoke the "put-into-tmux-buffer" script.  that addressed the most significant pain point of getting the path out of vim and into tmux so i could drop it into a different program
2022-05-07 21:42:20	romainl	ok
2022-05-07 21:42:25	nahcetan	but sometimes i want the path in the current vim.  so with my current mapping i have to get it into tmux.  which is slower and more annoying than it needs to be.
2022-05-07 21:42:42	nahcetan	only to then paste out of tmux back into vim
2022-05-07 21:44:49	nahcetan	now though..  i guess one solution is just to have some common function that's called both by these custom yanks mappings and by the TextYankPost autocmd.  it would take the register name and contents.

2022-05-08 16:24:01	unmatched-paren	hello! is there a way to make a `syn region` non-greedy?
2022-05-08 16:25:03	unmatched-paren	`syn region foobar start="\v\{" end="\v\}"` matches the entirety of `{ ... } }` as part of the region, but i don't want to match that last brace
2022-05-08 16:25:04	romainl	define "non-greedy"  in this context
2022-05-08 16:25:35	unmatched-paren	i want to make it stop at the first closing brace it encounters, not the last

I actually do do Meta-Esc in urxvtc to go into "vim mode", which is decent, in order to select and yank part or all of a line. And I extensively use the url-selection. Meta-u and the lowest URL is selected, then j/k to

2022-05-09 21:16:16	romainl	ideally, you should configure your terminal emulator to something that works well for it, like xterm-256color and let that value propagate itself through various programs
2022-05-09 21:16:26	novasenco	if you do  TERM=linux vim  then vim will think your terminal only supports 3-bit colors - not 8-bit colors. So, t_Co will probably be 8 - not 256
2022-05-09 21:16:53	novasenco	hence why you shouldn't change TERM. That is used by terminfo and vim to guess what terminal you're in, and you're lying

It has been known to cause issues with terminals that piggy back off of xterm's terminfo file without providing all of the capabilities that xterm provides. When you set TERM, you're broadcasting to programs that care what your terminal "is" (or what capabilities it can expect to

2022-06-12 22:14:09	phy1729	You appear to be using a vi which doesn't understand UTF-8, so dunno. You'd have to ask the people that support that vi (it's probably a clone not the real vi).

2022-06-12 22:16:49	tirnanog	for what it is worth, I can confirm that the implementation from ex-vi.sourceforge.net is sensitive to LC_CTYPE.
2022-06-12 22:17:03	tirnanog	so, you might want to run "locale" in your shell and see what is in effect.

2022-06-18 15:28:46	zeraphel	win_execute will switch the context to that of a different buffer,  'normal 12G' and call 'call mysomething()' will work on that (popup) window just fine.
2022-06-18 15:31:06	jclsn	zeraphel: Wel it works if I manually call cursor(1,1) after it has rendered. I think the issue is that I am rendering a terminal buffer in the popup buffer, which takes some time and overrides the cursor position

2022-06-18 15:37:58	jclsn	zeraphel: It does though. Maybe because it is a terminal buffer in a popup

2022-06-18 17:07:28	nickspoon	poopsticks: +clipboard is a compiled feature. So no, if it's not in the "original vim package" on your system, you can't get it in that package

2022-08-31 05:52:45	birkoff	what is the proper way to handle undoing autocmd doing mappings in a FileType event ?
2022-08-31 05:53:53	→	cyberworm54 has joined #vim
2022-08-31 05:55:27	nickspoon	I don't understand the question
2022-08-31 05:56:41	→	skered has joined #vim
2022-08-31 05:56:49	nickspoon	Do you mean you created mappings for a filetype but you don't want them to apply later on in other filetypes?
2022-08-31 05:56:57	←	medium_cool has quit (Quit: I have gone to sleep. ZZZzzz…)
2022-08-31 05:57:29	nickspoon	There are two parts to this. The first is that for filetype-based mappings you should be creating buffer-local mappings, so they only apply to the current buffer
2022-08-31 05:57:54	nickspoon	:nnoremap <buffer> ...
2022-08-31 05:58:05	nickspoon	That might be enough for most situations

2022-08-31 05:58:44	→	rockystone has joined #vim
2022-08-31 05:58:53	nickspoon	If you want that mapping (or any other settings) to be reset after actually _changing_ a buffer's filetype to something else, then that is done with :h undo_ftplugin
2022-08-31 05:58:53	digmbot	:help undo_ftplugin -> http://vimhelp.appspot.com/usr_51.txt.html#undo_ftplugin

2022-08-31 06:19:53	birkoff	just in case who knows (for the second case)
2022-08-31 06:21:26	birkoff	with undo_ftplugin it would be simply be : autocmd FileType myft unmap ....  ?
2022-08-31 06:22:04	nova	hi nickspoon how is your vay cay shun lucky dude
2022-08-31 06:22:17	→	volga629 has joined #vim
2022-08-31 06:22:22	birkoff	I meant: autocmd FileType myft let b:undo_ftplugin = "unmap <key1> | unmap <key2>"
2022-08-31 06:23:31	birkoff	or even better unmap <buffer> 
2022-08-31 06:23:35	nickspoon	birkoff: you use <buffer> in the unmap command too
2022-08-31 06:23:40	nickspoon	yeah exactly

2022-08-31 06:31:57	nickspoon	I will admit I've never done this with FileType autocmds, but it should be fine
2022-08-31 06:32:18	nickspoon	I prefer to use ftplugin/<filetype>.vim files for filetype configuration
2022-08-31 06:33:02	nova	link code when question or I will toilet paper bomb your house and dump a vat of honey over it too. jk not jk but jk
2022-08-31 06:33:39	birkoff	i don't why it would run when I open a filetype

2022-08-31 06:34:05	nova	prolly cuz mistake in da codes which we can't see
2022-08-31 06:34:13	birkoff	b:undo_ftplugin should only run when leaving a buffer no?

2022-09-02 03:59:54	nickspoon	dfdx: No problem. At one stage I got really confused when I was talking to someone who couldn't see marks in their sign column - I had totally forgotten that it wasn't part of vanilla vim, it feels very natural
2022-09-02 04:00:05	→	rsjw has joined #vim
2022-09-02 04:00:59	rsjw	in sh files why do two equals signs look blended together as one equals sign of double width?
2022-09-02 04:01:53	nickspoon	rsjw: that sounds like something your terminal and font combo is doing?
2022-09-02 04:02:00	→	jfsimon1981 has joined #vim
2022-09-02 04:02:43	rsjw	it doesn't happen when I run just vim, but if I do vim file.sh it does. so it's not the terminal or font
2022-09-02 04:03:10	nickspoon	Does it also happen if you put those characters in a string in that file?
2022-09-02 04:03:15	nickspoon	'=='
2022-09-02 04:03:17	→	tirnanog has joined #vim
2022-09-02 04:03:29	rsjw	no it does not
2022-09-02 04:04:15	woland	nickspoon: peekaboo is similar to signature but for registers
2022-09-02 04:05:12	nickspoon	rsjw: I'm not sure, it could be the font displaying a ligature, or displaying the = signs as extra wide in bold or something?
2022-09-02 04:05:37	nickspoon	Can you try to compare with a different font? Is this terminal vim or gvim?
2022-09-02 04:05:55	rsjw	nickspoon: I think it's directed by vim though. it's terminal vim
2022-09-02 04:07:08	→	wurstwasser has joined #vim
2022-09-02 04:07:27	nickspoon	Vim can only use the fonts it has access to, it can't join characters up like that. It _can_ say that these characters should be bold or italic or underlined, and then the terminal and font work out how that should look

2022-09-02 04:07:46	nickspoon	You could try in a different terminal too
2022-09-02 04:08:13	rsjw	oh I see. yeah, it might be because it's bolded. it's the same color as other bold stuff
2022-09-02 04:10:01	rsjw	yeah it's the terminal's bold setting. I ran tput bold and now all the equals signs are joined together

2022-09-02 04:10:24	LeoNerd	Most terminals usually do a high-brightness colour change in combination with bold

2022-09-02 04:45:06	nickspoon	I'm installing it now
2022-09-02 04:46:02	nickspoon	I have ; mapped to : and use , as a secondary leader, so when I'm using vanilla f and F I have mappings for <space>; and <space>, for those. Which work but are a bit annoying. clever-f looks like just the thing
2022-09-02 04:46:08	woland	Its highly efficient imo. you may want to check asterisk improved too. I dont have a use for it but you might
2022-09-02 04:46:35	woland	nickspoon: same. I have ; mapped to :
2022-09-02 04:46:50	nickspoon	It works a bit like my vim-movefast plugin too, so I'm used to lots of repeated single taps when in a sub-mode

2022-09-02 04:51:11	woland	I think there are fzf plugins for buff hist and many other things
2022-09-02 04:51:27	woland	I personally hate fzf in all shape and form
2022-09-02 04:51:42	nickspoon	Maybe. I don't hate it, there are situations I've liked it, but I don't use it regularly
2022-09-02 04:52:06	nickspoon	But a local buffer list which is ordered by last visited is very useful.
