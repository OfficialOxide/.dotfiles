2022-09-02 03:43:57	parsnip	bpalmer: is it better to use a parsing library, rather than writing regexp?
2022-09-02 03:44:22	bpalmer	I mean, it depends how complicated the structure is.
2022-09-02 03:44:37	bpalmer	For the general case, html cannot be parsed with regular expressions.
2022-09-02 03:45:24	bpalmer	if it's literally replacing a single document so that, e.g., things that are in lang="ab" get replaced with a fixed glossary ...
2022-09-02 03:45:54	timmur	structure is fairly simple. I have a html string which I would like to trim to get the text in between <span lang= to </span> tags.
