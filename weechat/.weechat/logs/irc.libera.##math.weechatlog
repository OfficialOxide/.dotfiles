2021-08-20 15:44:23	newpy	oh so b/c we subtract 4C3 and 3C2 we over-subtract the 4-pairs

2021-08-20 15:45:13	int-e	4C2*9!/4 - 3C2*4C3*8!/2!  accounts correctly for configurations with 2 pairs or 3 pairs, but configurations with 4 pairs are still (probably) miscounted.
2021-08-20 15:45:59	int-e	It's *very* easy to get confused in this. I'd recommend to count configurations with *exactly* 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0 pairs, in that order.

2021-08-20 15:47:03	kobalt	exactly 4 pairs = 7!
2021-08-20 15:47:31	int-e	But of course we can make this work... the first term counts 4-pair-configurations 6 times; the second term counts them -12 times, so we need to add some back...

2021-08-20 16:42:47	int-e	Still, we can add a disjointness constraint for the pairs.

2021-08-21 03:12:48	qergle	right. how about if it lands heads 95% of the time?
2021-08-21 03:13:34	LTCD	qergle (0.95)*(10) + (0.05)*(-200) = -0.5 which is an unfair game.

2021-08-21 03:14:11	qergle	the lobsided payoffs +10 and -200 mean that you'd need an incredibly unfair coin (96%+ heads) to make it a worthwhile bet.
2021-08-21 03:14:22	qergle	even a coin that lands heads 95% of the time is a losing proposition.

2021-08-21 19:09:50	mawk	I vaguely remember how to prove the Γ(x)Γ(1-x) one which involves identification of the coefficients of the various poles of lhs and rhs, but it presumes you recognize that Γ(x)Γ(1-x) has the same poles as something that looks like 1/sin(πx)

2021-08-21 20:16:00	riv	i get using the e^(-x) so you have a convergent geometric series

2021-08-21 20:29:10	Z-module	Hmm, not sure if this is that pretty, but kind of neat.  Let A be an m x n matrix, and B be n x m, and let X denote the indeterminate used in our characteristic polyinomials.  Then:   X^n charpoly(AB) = X^m charpoly(BA)
2021-08-21 20:29:24	riv	you could even work out an expression for the 11th roots of unity, but it invovles 5th roots
2021-08-21 20:29:24	pikapika	because its a symmetric 6th order equation which means its a quadratic of a cubic
2021-08-21 20:29:59	pikapika	riv, are you thinking in terms of (x+1/x) powers too
2021-08-21 20:30:12	riv	no
2021-08-21 20:30:27	riv	that gives you real values doesn't it?
2021-08-21 20:30:40	pikapika	I was thinking of rephrasing 1+x+...x^10 in terms of (1+1/x)^5+...
2021-08-21 20:30:57	pikapika	riv, not necessarily. Its just a trick that can be used if the coefficients are symmetric
2021-08-21 20:31:47	riv	ah neat
2021-08-21 20:32:00	pikapika	*(x+1/x)
2021-08-21 20:32:05	int-e	Z-module: Assume wlog that n>=m; you can just fill the matrices up with zeros up to size n^2 to make them square, and get X^|n-m| charpoly(AB) = charpoly(BA)
2021-08-21 20:32:21	pikapika	But its interesting. I didn't know that all roots of unity were expressible in this manner.
2021-08-21 20:33:09	int-e	Z-module: Or you can fill up to size (n+m)^2 and get what you wrote.
2021-08-21 20:33:16	riv	one cool thing is that the cube roots can be done with origami folds
2021-08-21 20:33:29	riv	so in theory you could construct zeta_7 using origami
2021-08-21 20:33:50	pikapika	the cube root only involves sqrt(3) so of course
2021-08-21 20:33:59	pikapika	there can be easy geometric techniques
2021-08-21 20:34:08	pikapika	because its easy to make sqrt(3)/2 I think

2021-08-21 20:37:23	pikapika	riv, I mean if you think about it...its just about making an equilateral triangle
2021-08-21 20:37:25	buster	oh. would have to be (all eigenspaces except the 0-eigenspace) are 1-dimensional, but maybe it still works

2021-08-21 20:44:06	cherim	F(G) is more often Fitting than Frattini
2021-08-21 20:44:11	Z-module	(I hadn't noticed that A_5 has this property.)
2021-08-21 20:44:27	cherim	Frattini is then Phi(G)
2021-08-21 20:45:14	cherim	Tr[AX] = Tr[XA] for X=BAB...AB, hence Tr[ (AB)^k ] = Tr[ (BA)^k ]. The power symmetric functions of (zero-padded) eigenvalues are the same, so are the elementary symmetric functions.

2021-08-21 23:27:48	newpy	somehow it reduces the original expression to 1 / 3(2n+1)^2  +  1 / 5(2n+1)^4 ...
2021-08-21 23:28:27	riv	well t = 1/(2n+1), so you get (n + 1/2) * (1/(2n+1) + (1/3)[1/(2n+1)]^3 + (1/5)[1/(2n+1)]^5...)
2021-08-21 23:28:29	newpy	obviously they multiply (n + 1/2) by 2 to get (2n+1) in the numerator

2021-08-21 23:46:20	Z-module	Even better, riv:  Let A, B be any two countable sets of reals, each dense in R.  Then there exists a transcendental (= non-polynomial) entire complex function f with  f(z) in B   iff   z in A.  You could use A = B = Q  there.

2021-08-21 23:59:22	qergle	forget the numbers a second. can you have 4 kids getting zero prizes?
2021-08-21 23:59:23	Z-module	oh, hmmm, I think the f I mentioned there will be bijective from A -> B actually, but (as any transc. entire function must) it will map countably infinitely many nonreal z onto each q in B (with maybe one exception).  So I think the  f(z) in B  iff  z in A    property there is just for real z.
2021-08-22 00:00:35	kobalt	I think no.
2021-08-22 00:01:05	qergle	it's no, you have to distribute the 10 prizes somewhere, and you can't if they all get 0.

2021-08-22 20:36:58	tmyklebu_	i see.  but you have constraints to deal with, and presumably you get an infeasible solution by doing that.  so you'll need to switch at least one variable to 0, which carries a cost of at least 3, no?
2021-08-22 20:37:42	Kaylah	indeed I think that's correct, but I think that's why they only call it a "bound", the bound is determined by ignoring the constraints
2021-08-22 20:38:01	Kaylah	so it just tells you that the actual solution (taking into account the constraints) can never be higher than that bound
2021-08-22 20:38:18	Kaylah	here's another example which I don't understand either, if that helps: https://i.imgur.com/ZqBcZjd.png
2021-08-22 20:40:06	cherim	Second example matches what they say but the 4-28 doesn't
2021-08-22 20:40:56	tmyklebu_	i'm saying you can tighten the bound by checking if the constraints are satisfied at the unconstrained optimum.  if not, you have to toggle at least one variable, which tightens your bound.  i'm not clear on how they determine infeasibility either.  checking consistency of a set of linear inequalities is equivalent to linear programming.
2021-08-22 20:41:13	tmyklebu_	and if you're doing LP, why not just compute LP solutions?
2021-08-22 20:42:06	Kaylah	this is just a specific solution method for LP with only binary variables
2021-08-22 20:42:28	cherim	You can indeed cross out the nodes on 4-28 by doing exactly one extra level ("toggle out one"), but you need the 32 bound which is ahead in DFS
2021-08-22 20:42:29	Kaylah	cherim could you tell me how they do it in the second example?
2021-08-22 20:43:12	cherim	And it's a strange idea to omit that one level for demonstrating the idea
2021-08-22 20:43:43	cherim	Obviously, they don't do LP because variables are in {0, 1}.
2021-08-22 20:44:26	cherim	But they don't claim any depth beyond the very basic branch-and-bound, so it's not a big loss not to explai every node on 4-28
2021-08-22 20:44:39	cherim	Can safely move forward

2021-08-22 20:47:17	cherim	It's just what they promise on 4-24, 4-26
2021-08-22 20:47:23	cherim	But 4-28 is indeed strange

2021-08-22 21:02:38	Kaylah	hmm cherim I did some calculations and I can see that for node 5 of Ex. 4 for instance (x1=0, x2=1), you can never satisfy the last constraint as you said
2021-08-22 21:02:46	Kaylah	so I understand that node 5 is crossed out
2021-08-22 21:03:04	Kaylah	but then what's the difference with node 4 for instance?
2021-08-22 21:03:17	Kaylah	because for node 4 you can also never satisfy all 3 constraints
2021-08-22 21:03:38	Kaylah	either the last one or the third one is not satisfied, so I don't understand why they keep branching from node 4 instead of crossing it out
2021-08-22 21:04:13	cherim	They don't do this "either or" thing. Only check each constraint separately
2021-08-22 21:04:23	Kaylah	aah I think I get it, yes
2021-08-22 21:04:28	Kaylah	was just about to ask that
2021-08-22 21:04:54	cherim	All more complex arguments are dropped since fixing a new variable will give you more per effort spent
2021-08-22 21:04:56	Kaylah	so for node 4, there is a certain configuration for which constraint 1 is fulfilled, there's also one for which constraint 2 is fulfilled, and also one for which constraint 3 is fulfilled
2021-08-22 21:05:13	→	twoisprime has joined ##math
2021-08-22 21:05:14	Kaylah	and at this point we don't check yet if those configurations overlap (i.e. if they can be fulfilled at the same time), if I get it right
2021-08-22 21:05:25	Kaylah	but for node 5 we see that constraint 3 is never fulfilled, so we cross it out

2021-08-22 21:09:13	Kaylah	mr(s) cherim awesome! I used excel to quickly do the calculations and I get the exact same result: https://i.imgur.com/XrjaPLF.png
2021-08-22 21:09:52	Kaylah	on the right I have 4 tables which contain the values of the variables; in the top table I wrote the values that I impose (ie the fixed ones)
2021-08-22 21:10:26	Kaylah	then in the second table for instance, I take over those imposed values and fill in the most ideal ones for constraint 1 for the free variables, and then I check constraint 1 right beneath it
2021-08-22 21:10:39	Kaylah	in the third table I do the same for constraint 2, and fourth table for constraint 3
2021-08-22 21:11:21	Kaylah	so if any of those 3 checks is "NOK", it means that even in the most preferable situation from the constraint's point of view, the constraint is not fulfilled, and hence it can be scratched out
2021-08-22 21:11:37	Kaylah	and the columns with a "NOK" are exactly the ones corresponding to the nodes that are crossed out :)
2021-08-22 21:13:03	Kaylah	thank you very much for your help mr(s) cherim and mr(s) tmyklebu_

2021-08-25 00:26:32	Z-module	barravince: do you mean the limsup and liminf of the given sequence?
2021-08-25 00:26:49	Z-module	there's no really general method

2021-08-25 00:27:01	Z-module	of what?
2021-08-25 00:27:09	barravince	of any given sequence defined in R
2021-08-25 00:27:49	Z-module	We don't speaking of those things of a *sequence* per se. We speak of the lim sup or the lim inf of the sequence, or some the sup or inf of the *set* of distinct values of the sequence (but these are different in general from lim sup, lim inf)
2021-08-25 00:27:58	Z-module	or sometimes*
2021-08-25 00:28:35	Z-module	plain old sup and inf (= least upper bound, greatest lower bound) apply to bounded nonempty sets of reals.

2021-08-25 00:29:42	barravince	well this is what I am referring to then, not the limits, but the sup and inf of a bounded non-empty set of reals

2021-08-25 00:46:54	arseniiv	Guest64: if Ideals, varieties, and algorithms (Cox, Little, O’Shea) is available to you, I think there should be such a definition. The book deals with affine varieties though I have read it just for a bit years ago
2021-08-25 00:47:28	arseniiv	(if that’s not your book already, in which case oops)
2021-08-25 00:47:29	Guest64	well, it has defined the dimension of a linear variety...
2021-08-25 00:47:43	Guest64	and yeah that is the one i have
2021-08-25 00:47:55	arseniiv	linear varieties are way simpler though, oh
2021-08-25 00:48:33	Guest64	yeah its just what you expect straight from linear algebra. But generally, for ~affine varieties~ idk
2021-08-25 00:49:14	arseniiv	I’d think one would need to go through the number of equations of the system or something, but that seems like a bad way to do it in general, as there will be many caveats, so surely the definition should be something else

2021-08-25 00:49:57	barravince	<arseniiv> yeah i meant Priestley, it was advised on the module handbook and I took it from library and I found it quite helpful and not too overly complex
2021-08-25 00:51:46	arseniiv	if we did analysis, we’d try to obtain a dimension of a tangent linear space at a point, but the point should be a good one, no cusps and self-intersections and things like that, but that would be too general and too, well, unacceptable. Affine varieties are sufficiently good to have their own specialized way to know their dimension

2021-08-25 18:22:25	PlanckWalk	I doubt it's that easy, but I thought I'd pretty check it :)
2021-08-25 18:22:30	PlanckWalk	I'd better*
2021-08-25 18:23:03	DnzAtWrk	is there such a thing as local frequency spectrum normalization
2021-08-25 18:23:23	PlanckWalk	1/(2 pi)  being transcendental is well-approximable, so it's probably worse than this density argument implies.
2021-08-25 18:23:24	Juliu	If 1/n^(2 + sin(n)) converges depends on the ratio how often you hit a multiple of Pi vs something else, I'd say
2021-08-25 18:24:23	Juliu	and since you will never hit a multiple of Pi, it will converge
2021-08-25 18:24:48	PlanckWalk	You don't need to hit it, just get close enough to it infinitely often.

2021-08-25 18:25:57	PlanckWalk	It's easy to show a sequence a_n > 1 for all n, but Sum 1/n^(a_n) diverges.
2021-08-25 18:26:13	Juliu	Really?
2021-08-25 18:26:30	PlanckWalk	Yep.  The power-law convergence thing only applies to constant powers
2021-08-25 18:26:50	Juliu	If you say so. Interesting
2021-08-25 18:27:02	Juliu	I bet it converges anyway
2021-08-25 18:27:12	rubiksdream	apparently it diverges
2021-08-25 18:27:21	rubiksdream	(and there is a proof)
2021-08-25 18:27:23	Juliu	Are you sure?
2021-08-25 18:27:24	int-e	a_n = log(n+1)/log(n)  clearly fits the bill
2021-08-25 18:27:35	rubiksdream	i trust Z-module , so yes
2021-08-25 18:27:49	Juliu	Z-module was wrong before. Just saying
2021-08-25 18:27:54	int-e	(for PlanckWalk's a_n > 1 claim)
2021-08-25 18:28:10	PlanckWalk	Yes, that one is very easy to check :)
2021-08-25 18:28:12	rubiksdream	well.. he is talking about a proof he knows exists of this fact lol
2021-08-25 18:28:20	Z-module	Yes, I said it turns out to diverge. I'll point you to the proof if you like, but it's in French. Actually this paper shows that  SUM 1/n^(2 + cos(n + theta))   diverges for any fixed theta.
2021-08-25 18:28:43	int-e	PlanckWalk: the density argument should give soemthing roughly like 1/n^(1 + 1/n^2)? Eww.
2021-08-25 18:29:10	PlanckWalk	Vaguely like that yes

2021-08-25 21:19:02	droid3	And for finite fields we already know that they can all be represented/realized as polynomial arithmetic mod irredicuibles or mod p ...etc
2021-08-25 21:19:51	droid3	So the even bigger point is that all this abstract ring and field theory breaks down into arithmetic with matrices objects or polynomial objects.
2021-08-25 21:21:43	→	nate1 has joined ##math
2021-08-25 21:21:57	droid3	Thats kind of huge as it tells mathematicians that for rings and fields of finite type the objects to model them (aka isomorphic object) come from matrices or polynomials or direct products of them
2021-08-25 21:22:10	→	oxum has joined ##math
2021-08-25 21:22:31	droid3	And that no other objects other then matrices and polynomials would be need to model an isomorphic arithmetic which is kind of neat.
2021-08-25 21:23:59	droid3	It seems then that any abstract algebra object we cook up that falls into being a ring or finite field can be model as matrices or polynomials as arithmetic...one needs not learn any thing other then matrices and polynomial arithmetic to beable to do arithmetic for any ring or finite field.
2021-08-25 21:25:01	→	Donitz has joined ##math
2021-08-25 21:25:04	droid3	There probably some holes in this but for the most part it seems matrice and polynomial arithmetic are all that is need to model/build up any ring or finite field arithmetic
2021-08-25 21:25:30	droid3	This is in some sense much easier to work with / deal with then classification of finite groups
2021-08-25 21:26:28	droid3	which as of current we have found that all finite simple groups can be classified into sporadic , lie type , cyclic ,alternating types
2021-08-25 21:27:06	int-e	another day, another monolog... why
2021-08-25 21:28:36	droid3	And since all finite groups can be broken down into direct products of finite simple groups in certain ways then we kind of know the bounds on the structure of all finite groups. However groups that arent finite (aka not permutation groups) have no such classification that i am aware of.

2021-08-25 21:33:22	droid3	Like can we decompose all rings into simple ring or a direct product of simple rings???
2021-08-25 21:33:55	Z-module	I'm 99% sure that's false
2021-08-25 21:34:42	droid3	ya was kind of figuring that. So only simple rings can be expressed / represented completely by a ring of nxn matrice over a division ring.
2021-08-25 21:34:53	droid3	Not all rings!!! :(
2021-08-25 21:36:01	droid3	though if the simple ring is finite it reduce to being isomorphic to a ring of nxn matrices over a field trivially
2021-08-25 21:36:15	droid3	Because any finite division ring is a field
2021-08-25 21:37:12	droid3	At any extent so classification of rings in general that arent simple is still unknown like the classification of all finite groups is still unknown.
2021-08-25 21:39:02	droid3	So in this case i guess saying all simple rings and finite fields can be realized/expressed as either matrices or polynomial arithmetic...aka there expressible as a matrice object or polynomial object
2021-08-25 21:39:34	droid3	which is kind of cool as we all know and love matrices and polynomial object to work with :)

2021-08-25 22:02:22	→	hyiltiz has joined ##math
2021-08-25 22:04:54	droid3	anyway ya of that subject for now it would have been nice if all finite rings could be expressed as either a finite field or a matrice over division rings we have the whole shebang then
2021-08-25 22:05:05	droid3	But its not as nice as that :(
2021-08-25 22:06:08	droid3	there still finite commutative rings which are not integer domains thus not fields
2021-08-25 22:07:33	droid3	and there is still finite noncommutative rings the even worse case
2021-08-25 22:08:35	droid3	So i guess what i am still wondering is do we have any theorems saying commutative finite rings can be represented as a matrix nxn group over some finite field or ring ???
2021-08-25 22:11:08	droid3	And can every finite noncommutative ring be represented thru matrices
2021-08-25 22:12:26	Z-module	If S is any finite commutative ring, then (Z/4Z) x S contains at least one nonzero nilpotent element, namely (2,0), so by a known theorem, (Z/4Z) x S can't be semisimple (= direct sum of simple rings). So there's a nice infinite family of finite non-semisimple rings.
2021-08-25 22:12:42	droid3	I suppose the first question is trivial if we represent it as a module over itself or as a 1x1 matrice as an module
2021-08-25 22:13:17	droid3	But i suppose the better statement is can in general all finite rings be represented as a matrice over some field?
2021-08-25 22:14:03	droid3	Obviously all finite rings can be represented as a 1x1 matrice over itself but thats kind of a trivial representation thats not so useful.
2021-08-25 22:15:17	droid3	YA THE QUESTION IS CAN ALL FINITE RINGS BE REPRESENTED AS A NXN MATRIX OVER A FINITE FIELD?

2021-08-25 22:18:52	droid3	ya but i can see by n^2 elements in a matrice and p^m we have p^m^n2 orders achievable thru matrices
2021-08-25 22:18:57	Z-module	The full ring of n x n matrices over a field of order p^k (p prime) has order  p^(k n^2).   So no finite ring whose order has two or more prime factors will be such a thing.
2021-08-25 22:19:38	droid3	Ya so i can kind of see that it wouldnt work as then you just have to show a finite ring of order not equal to p^^m^n^2

2021-08-25 22:23:52	droid3	Ya your right you really need the commutative to make arithmetic really work well .
2021-08-25 22:25:40	droid3	hummm ok never mind so finite rings that arent division , integer domains ...etc arent fields but also nessarily have nice representation in matrice forms unless they fall into being simple.

2021-08-27 00:15:44	buster	it probably isn't worth getting too fussy about it. if you can find the difference in latitude going 100m north, and the difference in longitude going 100m east, you can stretch the circle vertically and horizontally by those factors. (you'll be in trouble if you visit the poles, of course.)

2021-08-27 00:26:53	buster	you can say "maximum in absolute value" (or "in modulus" but that's a little old fashioned)

2021-08-27 18:49:13	tmyklebu_	kobalt: (1) in some cases, generating series elucidate fast algorithms for computing the thing in question by giving you a computational algebra problem instead of a combinatorics problem.  (2) for some generating series, complex analysis lets you study e.g. asymptotics of coefficients via roots and poles of the generating series.  (3) sometimes generating series give you easy proofs of otherwise tricky

2021-08-27 18:53:49	int-e	My favorite surprising g.f. problem is this: Design two non-standard six-sided dice with positive integers as labels such that their sum's distribution is the same as that of casting two standard dice.
2021-08-27 18:53:58	kobalt	tmyklebu_: yes, I understand it could be used for problems that have some contraints in it. the issue is to evaluating the coeffs is difficult.

For any r in R, the additive inverse of it, denoted -r, is the same as the ring product  (-1)r   where -1 is the additive inverse of 1.

2021-08-28 01:03:04	Z-module	[-_-]: a ring is defined to be a set R equipped with two binary operations, called addition and multiplication generically but that doesn't mean anything by itself. Addition is very nearly always denoted '+' and multiplication is denoted by juxtaposing symbols (or by '*' or various other possibilities).  In your ring of n x n matrices (over some given field), the addition operation is ordinary matrix addition, where A + B means just use
2021-08-28 01:03:04	Z-module	the field addition within each pair of corresponding entries. YOu can see that A + B = B + A  always holds, because  x + y = y + x   for all x, y in the field.
2021-08-28 01:04:06	Z-module	(and for the general ring, those two binary operations have to satisfy a list of axioms you should know, [-_-] )
2021-08-28 01:04:45	Z-module	one of those axioms is actually  r + s = s + r   for all r, s in R.  So "addition is commutative by axiom".

Doing so for different years, e.g. 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and so on, we can get yearly observed (in the data) transition matrices. If you th

2021-08-28 01:34:39	majestic	If you then take the average of all these matrices, you would get an average transition matrix which gives you the transitions youd expect to see an average year. If you then multiply this matrix with itself those are the transition probabilities youd expect to see over a 2-year horizon. But when I am comparing the multiplication with itself, to the 2-year observed average transition matrix, they are far from close to each other.
2021-08-28 01:34:40	[-_-]	I guess I am not forgetting this

In other words application of [D,*] or E is sort of like taking the tensor product with a vector space V or its dual V*, respectively.

2021-08-28 18:27:49	joel135	Since [D,*] is cocontinuous it is as if it were Ax* for some imaginary 'negative object' A. The right adjoint of [D,*] is the right adjoint of Ax*, which may be written [A,*].

2021-08-28 18:31:37	Z-module	riv, note that for these general powers of things involving complex numbers, if not told otherwise you'll generally need to use the "principal value", so for example i^i means  exp( i Log(i) ) = exp( i ( ln(|i|) + i Arg(i) ) ) = exp( i ( i pi/2 ) ) = exp(-pi/2).  That Arg in there is the principal arg, whose definition you have to fix. It's most often one of:  the unique choice in (-pi, pi],  the unique choice in [-pi, pi),  the unique
2021-08-28 18:31:37	Z-module	choice in [0, 2pi).  There isn't really a single standard.

2021-08-29 05:43:55	mawk	basically the idea is to "complete the square"
2021-08-29 05:44:32	mawk	ax²+bx looks like the start of the expansion of a[x + b/(2a)]²
2021-08-29 05:45:03	mawk	so you add the missing term to make it really the expansion of that, then you subtract it at the same time to keep all things equal

2021-08-29 06:05:01	zacts	knuth's concrete mathematics is probably more number theory than conway's book. conway's book is more playful, but still inspired I think by number theory.

2021-08-29 06:06:35	zacts	let's see if I can give some examples
2021-08-29 06:06:45	cherim	You guessed my second most hated book!
2021-08-29 06:07:06	qergle	conway is your 2nd most hated? what is your first?
2021-08-29 06:07:42	cherim	We discussed "Winning ways for your mathematical plays" yesterday
2021-08-29 06:07:42	shimbles	the first AI to treat mathematical syntax as a hyperparameter has joined
2021-08-29 06:07:55	qergle	never heard of that book
2021-08-29 06:08:00	zacts	ch2 is doing arithmetic and algebra by geometry
2021-08-29 06:08:08	cherim	Berlekamp/Conway/Guy
2021-08-29 06:08:09	zacts	it has lots of images there
2021-08-29 06:08:25	zacts	ch3 is what comes next, moessner's magic
2021-08-29 06:08:37	zacts	cherim: conway likes magic it seems :-P
2021-08-29 06:08:45	cherim	Well, technically second place in hate hierarchy is for people who suggest TAOCP as a source for studying algorithms
2021-08-29 06:08:56	cherim	But TAOCP is a good book, just on another topic
2021-08-29 06:09:03	qergle	sipser, innit?
2021-08-29 06:09:16	cherim	Concrete mathematics gets all the worst from Knuth's fixations though
2021-08-29 06:09:18	zacts	cherim: you don't like concrete mathematics?
2021-08-29 06:09:41	cherim	Yes, and in this area I am more qualified
2021-08-29 06:09:51	cherim	So I am pretty sure in my marks
2021-08-29 06:10:04	zacts	what do you dislike, and why?
2021-08-29 06:10:11	zacts	I'm considering working thru knuth's book too
2021-08-29 06:10:35	qergle	or am i thinking cormen
2021-08-29 06:10:41	qergle	i always get sipser and cormen mixed up

2021-08-29 06:29:49	evidlo	is there a nice compact and formal way to show that a bijection of a uniform random variable gives you another uniform random variable?

2021-08-29 06:33:31	Z-module	If X is uniform in [-1, 1], then Y = X^999 is a bijection but no longer uniform on [-1, 1]. I probably don't understand the intended question.
2021-08-29 06:39:20	evidlo	specifically I want to show that for m∈{0,1}^L and k~Unif({0,1})^L, the function xor(k, m) is still uniformly distributed
2021-08-29 06:39:34	→	Arcorann has joined ##math
2021-08-29 06:39:43	evidlo	my original question was bad, sorry
2021-08-29 06:39:54	Z-module	L is a natural number?
2021-08-29 06:40:14	evidlo	yes
2021-08-29 06:41:49	evidlo	its pretty easy to intuit just looking at the truth table, but does it generally hold true if xor is replaced with any bijection?
2021-08-29 06:42:33	evidlo	or a bijection from {0,1}^L to {0,1}^L, more specifically
2021-08-29 06:45:12	←	zacts has quit (Quit: Client closed)
2021-08-29 06:45:51	evidlo	I guess xor isn't a bijection, but xor(·, m) is for any m.  Just trying to formalize what I understand intuitively
2021-08-29 06:46:48	evidlo	my crypto class uses mostly plain language, so the proofs seem wordier than they need to be
2021-08-29 06:48:57	buster	a discrete random variable with, say, N possible values is uniform iff the probability of each outcome is equal (to 1/N)
2021-08-29 06:50:08	buster	it is true that permuting the values doesn't change that, yes. (intuitively, you could say you are only relabelling the outcomes.)
2021-08-29 06:50:55	Z-module	yeah, my example before with Unif([-1,1]) was only possible because [-1,1] is uncountable.
2021-08-29 06:54:08	→	johnkeats6 has joined ##math
2021-08-29 07:02:18	evidlo	right, but this doesn't work for e.g. and(k, m) since and(·, m) is not a bijection.  Does this property have a name?

2021-08-29 16:54:38	Fangs	the map Paths(X) -> X is given by (abusing notation a bit...) [x0 ------> y] \mapsto y
2021-08-29 16:55:00	quantum	ok
2021-08-29 16:55:11	Fangs	is that the space you're looking for?
2021-08-29 16:55:33	quantum	I think it is, Bredon does cover this by the looks of things, but I'm also looking to put some sort of smooth structure on it
2021-08-29 16:56:12	Fangs	most alg top book that covers covering space theory should at least talk about these spaces 'up to homotopy', so that's probably the farthest from any discussion of smooth structures
2021-08-29 16:56:14	quantum	the topology aspect looks useful though, I'll give it a read just so I can get familiar with it

2021-08-29 17:07:32	Fangs	is this relevant? https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/smooth+loop+space
2021-08-29 17:07:42	johnkeats7	afaik the useful theory of infinite dim'l manifolds is that of frechet manifolds. this paper looks good https://projecteuclid.org/journals/bulletin-of-the-american-mathematical-society-new-series/volume-7/issue-1/The-inverse-function-theorem-of-Nash-and-Moser/bams/1183549049.full

2021-08-29 23:14:14	Guest2	Yes. That's the basis of my proof. I can't find that explicitly anywhere.
2021-08-29 23:14:39	riv	so what you need to look for is the definition of the natural numbers
2021-08-29 23:15:02	riv	they can be defined in different ways, but they're all equivalent and what you end up with is:
2021-08-29 23:15:36	riv	A set N that has some '0' zero in it, and some 'S' such that for any n in N, S(n) is in N
2021-08-29 23:15:44	riv	with the ability to perform mathematical induction on these
2021-08-29 23:16:09	riv	you also need a definition of <=, this can be defined by induction
2021-08-29 23:16:49	riv	inductively you would define <= such that 0 <= n  always holds, S(m) <= 0 does not hold, S(m) <= S(n) holds iff m <= n holds
2021-08-29 23:17:03	riv	now you can prove x <= S(x) by induction on x

If you define an operation * on Q/S using:   [a/b]*[c/d] = [1/2] if b,d are both even, [0] otherwise, then you can check fairly easily that:  * is well defined,  (Q/S, usual +, this new *)  is actually a ring, infinitely many products in this

2021-08-31 07:22:10	tusko	I may be over thinking this, but I'd like to prove that if a|b and b|a, then a = +-b.
2021-08-31 07:24:12	Fangs	tusko: can you use the prime decomposition of integers?
2021-08-31 07:26:48	tusko	Is it enough to say a|b -> b=ak for some k \in Z and b|a -> a=bn for some n \in z. Substitution of one into the other results in nk=1.
2021-08-31 07:26:54	tusko	I don't even know what that is tbh
2021-08-31 07:27:03	tusko	I'm sure I could use it if I knew what i was.
2021-08-31 07:27:43	Fangs	tusko: yes, what are the solutions to nk = 1 over the integers

2021-08-31 07:28:14	tusko	um, hm... 1/k = n or 1/n =k?
2021-08-31 07:28:30	tusko	or, I guess (1,1) and (-1,-1)
2021-08-31 07:28:33	Fangs	integers
2021-08-31 07:28:36	Fangs	yeah
2021-08-31 07:29:00	tusko	so I see where you're going there
2021-08-31 07:30:01	tusko	In that case, since b = ak and a = bn, and since n and k are either 1 or -1, then a = +/- b (and b = +- a)?
2021-08-31 07:30:41	Fangs	yup
2021-08-31 07:31:10	tusko	idk why it feels like a suboptimal proof to me :/
2021-08-31 07:31:41	tusko	Math has never really been easy for me
2021-08-31 07:31:57	Fangs	idk what you're talking about, you just produced a really elegant proof
2021-08-31 07:32:38	tusko	idk, for example, we were proving in class today how many steps it should take to find the gcd.
2021-08-31 07:33:15	tusko	I had almost no idea what we were talking about. I still only understand maybe half of it
2021-08-31 07:33:23	tusko	I doubt I could reproduce such a proof.
2021-08-31 07:34:28	←	madez has quit (Quit: .)
2021-08-31 07:35:13	qergle	did you use subtraction or mod in your gcd algo?
2021-08-31 07:37:36	→	madez has joined ##math
2021-08-31 07:40:09	tusko	hm, so we did a = bq1 + r1 ... b = r1q2 + r2 ... r1 = r2q3 + r3 ... rt-2 = rt-1qt + rt
2021-08-31 07:41:00	tusko	and then, like, a > b > r1 > r2 > ... > rt-2 > rt > 0
2021-08-31 07:42:53	tusko	then we made some assumptions about r_i-1 > ri/2 or r_i-1 <= ri/2 to show that r_i-2 >= r_i/2 (Always)
2021-08-31 07:42:58	qergle	that's commonly called the euclidean algorithm
2021-08-31 07:43:04	tusko	I'll have to pull out my notes, because I was lost in the sauce
2021-08-31 07:43:10	←	voidah has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2021-08-31 07:43:52	tusko	yeah, so we were told Euclid's algorithm is like the best algorithm to find gcd for going on like 2000 years or something
2021-08-31 07:44:12	tusko	not sure if Euclid's algorithm == euclidean algorithm. I could be calling things wrong
2021-08-31 07:45:04	qergle	say we want gcd(12,88)
2021-08-31 07:45:32	qergle	so we can do that in 2 steps essentially
2021-08-31 07:45:51	qergle	88 = 7*12 + 4 -> 12 = 3*4 + 0 -> gcd=4
2021-08-31 07:46:12	tusko	right, boom gcd=4. Its incredible
2021-08-31 07:46:38	tusko	I also know now that it takes, I think, at worst 2k operations to do for any number. But the proof was bananas
2021-08-31 07:47:10	qergle	or something a little longer, say gcdd(1242,63);  1242=19*63+45 -> 445=2*18+9 -> 18=2*9+0 -> gcd=9
2021-08-31 07:47:30	Fangs	tusko: euclid's algorithm works over more fancy rings too
2021-08-31 07:47:38	Galois	finding the solutions of nk = 1 in the integers is just as hard as proving that if a|b and b|a then a = ± b
2021-08-31 07:48:22	Fangs	thats the proof they produced
2021-08-31 07:49:32	qergle	trivia: worst case scenario of euclidean algorithm gcd(F_n,F_{n+1}) iirc.
2021-08-31 07:49:39	Galois	the point is you have to prove nk = 1 has only (1,1) and (-1,-1) as solutions. This isn't automatic. For example it doesn't hold in the rationals.

2021-08-31 07:52:12	tusko	Right, true. This is a class in elementary cryptography, so we've been mostly restricted to integers or natural numbers. I'd like to take abstract algebra and/or number theory next, but I am a straight up dunce.
2021-08-31 07:52:54	Juliu	Hi guys
2021-08-31 07:53:03	Juliu	I dont think that cryptography exists
2021-08-31 07:53:11	Galois	well, if you want to learn it properly, you should do it properly.
2021-08-31 07:54:00	Fangs	Galois: |nk| >= |n| and |nk| >= |k| for non-zero n, k.. which should follow if you're willing to believe that  |z| >= 1 for any nonzero integer z
2021-08-31 07:54:01	qergle	crypto is a good environment in which to learn elementary nt
2021-08-31 07:54:06	→	hyiltiz has joined ##math
2021-08-31 07:54:50	Galois	good, so now you must prove z ≠ 0 → |z| ≥ 1
2021-08-31 07:54:59	qergle	tusko: have you seen a book by hoffstein/pipher/silverman?
2021-08-31 07:55:00	tusko	qergle, that's what I was hoping. Ya know, take a little nibble, then jump into a number theory course next semester
2021-08-31 07:55:09	Galois	(by the way, defining |z| is probably more trouble than it's worth in a computer proof assistant)
2021-08-31 07:55:12	tusko	I think that's our textbook, actually.
2021-08-31 07:55:27	qergle	this one i'm thinking is a springer/utm
2021-08-31 07:55:33	tusko	My prof was one of their students.
2021-08-31 07:55:34	Fangs	depending on how you define the integers, this is probably really annoying (I see you're already saying that)
2021-08-31 07:56:12	tusko	qergle, Yeah, yellow and blue text. I like it. Its very readable.
2021-08-31 07:56:18	Galois	it's enough to show that if 0 < z then ¬ z < 1.
2021-08-31 07:57:22	Galois	this is a commonly encountered proof in elementary number theory. Have you seen it before? (Do you -- OP -- care to learn it properly?)
2021-08-31 07:57:34	Fangs	if you take N x N/~ with (a,b) ~ (c,d) if.... {I want (a,b) to mean a-b.. so a-b=c-d iff a+d = c+b} if.... a+d = c+b
2021-08-31 07:57:49	Galois	oh you're using the construction of Z. Yes, you can do it that way.
2021-08-31 07:57:59	qergle	it's a nice book because aside from the basics, you get a nice section on ecc (elliptic curves) and one of the co-authors (silverman) is an expert. then you also get a section on lattice based crypto and the three co-authors pioneered this way back when cryptographers shunned mathematicians.
2021-08-31 07:58:22	←	grep_xtrange has quit (Quit: Quitting)
2021-08-31 07:58:33	Fangs	.. then you probably have to prove that each class has (0,n) or (n,0) representative, and define the norm as n..
2021-08-31 07:58:35	tusko	I'm pretty sure Schnorr claims to have broken RSA for some key size using a lattice method.

2021-08-31 08:04:55	Galois	it relies on the definition of "less than"
2021-08-31 08:04:57	tusko	I *think* ring means equipped with two operations, but i don't really know
2021-08-31 08:05:40	Fangs	tusko: we aren't really doing anything deep with anything relating to rings, we're just assuming you know how to add and multiply (and take the absolute value of integers)
2021-08-31 08:06:21	Galois	and the "deep" proof that I mentioned of ¬ 0 < z < 1 requires two things: properties of <, and induction / well-ordering
2021-08-31 08:06:43	tusko	I don't even know how to parse what that means
2021-08-31 08:06:54	dude12312414	at some point you also have to define + inductively in terms of Succ and < in terms of + and existence
2021-08-31 08:07:00	tusko	I think it means there is no nonzero integer between 0 and 1
2021-08-31 08:07:07	tusko	but isn't that obvious?
2021-08-31 08:07:08	Galois	you don't _have_ to do that. You can define + using axioms.
2021-08-31 08:07:11	dude12312414	(if you want to go down to the bare-bones Peano axioms)
2021-08-31 08:07:35	Fangs	tusko: yes, its 'obvious' but if I give you a ""model"" of the integers, how would you test if this model satisfies this ""obvious"" property?
2021-08-31 08:07:43	Galois	I've done it from Peano axioms, I've done it from ZFC axioms, I've done it from intuitionistic type theory, I've done it every which way

2021-08-31 08:09:07	Galois	ok here's the proof. No it's not a "different" proof than what Fangs did, it's just going deeper. We just want to prove there's no integer between 0 and 1.
2021-08-31 08:09:40	Galois	we'll assume the usual ordering relation <, and we'll assume that we know the natural numbers are well-ordered
2021-08-31 08:10:01	Juliu	Am I the only one thinking that most mathematical proofs are not real proofs and very informal?
2021-08-31 08:10:14	Galois	yes, but my proofs are as formal as you want them to be
2021-08-31 08:10:15	tusko	Bourbaki agreed with u
2021-08-31 08:10:29	Galois	I use bourbaki's axioms, but corrected
2021-08-31 08:10:47	tusko	so edgy :>
2021-08-31 08:11:03	Galois	Suppose there exists 0 < z < 1. Let x be the smallest such integer (guaranteed to exist by the well ordering principle) Then 0 < x^2 < x < 1, so x^2 is a smaller such number; contradiction.
2021-08-31 08:12:09	Juliu	Galois, a contradiction is not a problem and no reason that something does not exist, unless your axioms say otherwise. Which proves that your "proof" is informal
2021-08-31 08:12:14	tusko	What is the connection between that an proving that a|b and b| a => a = +/-b?
2021-08-31 08:12:21	Galois	Juliu: welcome to /ignore.

2021-08-31 08:13:01	Galois	What it has to do with a|b and b|a was explained by Fangs
2021-08-31 08:13:24	Fangs	12:32 <Fangs> |nk| >= |n| and |nk| >= |k| for non-zero n, k.. which should follow if you're willing to believe that  |z| >= 1 for any nonzero integer z <-- now you have to prove z=/=0 -> |z| >= 1
2021-08-31 08:13:28	qergle	the connection is that xy=1 ⇒ x=y=±1
2021-08-31 08:14:15	Fangs	tusko: at some point you had nk=1, so |nk| = |1| = 1, so 0 < |n| <= 1 and 0 < |k| <= 1
2021-08-31 08:14:35	Fangs	this is just a formalization of the step where you wenk nk = 1 implies n = k = -1 or n = k = 1
2021-08-31 08:14:49	qergle	for example, if you're not in ℤ, say you're in ℚ then xy=1 can have solution x=1/2,y=2, for example.
2021-08-31 08:14:53	tusko	I see, so then we needed to prove that there is no integer between 0 and 1
2021-08-31 08:14:57	Galois	right, there's something else you used there: if x|y and 0<y then x≤y
2021-08-31 08:15:27	Fangs	tusko: in general, it depends on how much you're willing to assume, as in my convo with Galois, you could go *all* the way down
2021-08-31 08:15:40	Fangs	12:39 <Galois> we'll assume the usual ordering relation <, and we'll assume that we know the natural numbers are well-ordered
2021-08-31 08:16:09	Fangs	we could have not assumed that, and look at the construction of the integers as tuples of (non-negative) natural umber (a,b)
2021-08-31 08:16:20	Fangs	then you can still go down and construct the natural numbers too
2021-08-31 08:16:22	qergle	if this were a crypto class with some elementary nt propping it up, i would assume xy=1 ⇒ x=y=±1 and use that to prove x|y and y|x ⇒ x=±y
2021-08-31 08:16:27	tusko	Oh, right, I see so then you'd want to prove natural numbers exist
2021-08-31 08:16:48	Fangs	or at least you have one model of it, for which whatever proposition you assert holds
2021-08-31 08:16:50	qergle	i re-used variables names in honor of hardy and wright
2021-08-31 08:17:02	Galois	qergle: but that's a circular argument, because you could just as easily claim to use x|y and y|x ⇒ x=±y to prove xy=1 ⇒ x=y=±1
2021-08-31 08:17:12	qergle	it was a re-use of variables
2021-08-31 08:17:22	tusko	qergle, I tried to buy a copy of their book but it sold
2021-08-31 08:17:27	Galois	I'm not worried about variable re-use, I'm worried about the lack of logical meaning
2021-08-31 08:17:57	Galois	it's like the usual circular proofs that (sin(x))' = cos(x)
2021-08-31 08:18:12	qergle	x|y and y|x -> x=ky, y=jx -> xy=xyjk -> jk=1 -> j=k=±1
2021-08-31 08:18:26	qergle	this gives what we seek
2021-08-31 08:18:43	Galois	conversely xy = 1 → x|1 and 1|x → x = ± 1
2021-08-31 08:19:26	Galois	you've just rephrased the problem into a closely equivalent alternative statement; you haven't proved anything
2021-08-31 08:19:48	←	Drek45 has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2021-08-31 08:20:04	qergle	that's true, because i am taking jk=1 -> j=k=±1 as a given

2021-08-31 08:20:09	⚡	Juliu gets popcorn
2021-08-31 08:20:41	Galois	to actually break out of the circularity, the critical idea is in fact induction or well ordering
2021-08-31 08:21:06	Galois	if you don't go at least deep enough to encounter that idea, you haven't really accomplished anything in my opinion
2021-08-31 08:22:02	Galois	you can then if you want go deeper to Peano axioms or ZFC axioms, and you'll learn something new for sure, but the first increment of learning occurs when you hit well ordering
2021-08-31 08:22:10	qergle	and i liked it. take the set S={z ∈ ℕ | 0 < z < 1}, WO gives a minimal element x in S. then x² ∈ S and x²<x, oops.
2021-08-31 08:22:45	qergle	but it might be more foundational than tusko's class is meant to be
2021-08-31 08:23:14	qergle	therefore S is empty
2021-08-31 08:23:16	Galois	it is surely more foundational than the class is intended, but it's not more foundational than what students really need to learn in order to be successful in number theoretic cryptography
2021-08-31 08:23:20	qergle	or something along those lines.

2021-08-31 08:23:51	Galois	it's the standard proof, and it isn't even a very artificial proof. The proof gets _directly_ to the heart of the reason why the statement is true.
2021-08-31 08:24:06	Galois	if you had 1/2, then you'd have 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, etc. and well-ordering fails

2021-08-31 08:25:01	Galois	ok, sure, you can do 1/2, 1/4, 1/16, ... if you wish
2021-08-31 08:25:11	Galois	I don't think this materially affects the concept
2021-08-31 08:25:20	tusko	Galois, but how can you begin by saying xy = 1?
2021-08-31 08:25:28	Galois	a|b and b|a
2021-08-31 08:25:32	Galois	so a=bx and b=ay
2021-08-31 08:25:37	Galois	so a=(ay)x
2021-08-31 08:25:54	Galois	so (and this is itself a nontrivial result) either a=0 or xy=1
2021-08-31 08:26:49	tusko	right, ok, but then from there you suggest that I should either prove well-ordering of the natural numbers or assume it and show ! 0 < z < 1?
2021-08-31 08:27:18	qergle	Galois assumed N is WO
2021-08-31 08:27:22	tusko	or perhaps well-ordering of the integers, since I need to show a = +/-b
2021-08-31 08:27:40	Galois	from xy=1 you can assume without loss of generality (!) that x and y are positive, so then x divides 1, so then (by another nontrivial result) x ≤ 1.
2021-08-31 08:27:58	Galois	if x = 1 then you're done, if x < 1 then (remember) x was positive, so 0 < x < 1, and then you show this is an impossibility

2021-08-31 08:28:28	tusko	by symmetry?
2021-08-31 08:28:43	Galois	I think this is the point where you have to stop asking questions and start doing the work yourself if you expect to learn anything. I've given you all the main ideas.
2021-08-31 08:28:46	Juliu	Contradiction does not mean impossible
2021-08-31 08:28:54	Fangs	let's summarise
2021-08-31 08:30:07	Galois	as for your question about well-ordering of the natural numbers, I would definitely assume that for now. Assuming it gets you to the main idea.
2021-08-31 08:31:14	Fangs	xy=1 ⇒ x=y=±1 is logically equivalent to x|y and y|x ⇒ x=±y and the point Galois was making was that you had to at least go one level deeper to prove a non-logically equivalent statement (i.e. at saysomething well-ordering or something about induction)
2021-08-31 08:31:16	tusko	Galois, I"ve understood what you said. I mean, really I came up with a good chunk of the proof already, besides this idea of xy = 1 -> x|1 and y|1 and |xy| = |1| = 1 so that 0 <= x <= 1 and 0 <= y <= 1. Then there emerges the need to show that there is no integer between 0 and 1.
2021-08-31 08:31:19	Fangs	(which was something I didn't catch)
2021-08-31 08:32:04	tusko	it should be < on the 0 side
2021-08-31 08:32:04	Galois	"logically equivalent" is a bit subjective since technically all true theorems are logically equivalent, but the point I make is that the two statements are very easily shown to be equivalent
2021-08-31 08:32:40	qergle	isn't that often the case in proofs though?
2021-08-31 08:32:52	Galois	yes, and then you have to prove at least one of the two
2021-08-31 08:33:11	qergle	you show via a set of steps that P and Q are equivalent statements and you began with Q as true by assumption (or priori knowledge)
2021-08-31 08:33:26	tusko	Honestly, my prof would probably love to see that proof. He asks us everyday to prove all sorts of 'obvious' things
2021-08-31 08:33:43	tusko	That is 'but why is it true'
2021-08-31 08:33:43	Galois	correct. But in this case doing that would lead to the outcome where you assume a|b → b|a → a=±b is true by assumption
2021-08-31 08:34:29	qergle	you assume xy=1 ⇒ x=y=±1 and then show that divisibility gives that a|b,b|a ⇒ a=±b
2021-08-31 08:34:58	Galois	I don't find that satisfying, because you're just assuming a closely related equivalent statement
2021-08-31 08:35:27	Galois	whereas well-ordering is NOT equivalent to a|b,b|a ⇒ a=±b
2021-08-31 08:35:34	Galois	(and THAT is also an interesting exercise, go do it!)
2021-08-31 08:35:36	qergle	i think you see this when the intent is to get students familiar with the implications of divisibility without getting into the makeup of N
2021-08-31 08:36:14	Galois	I don't think that serves the students well in this class. Using this book you would surely need to learn, say, modular arithmetic at some point.
2021-08-31 08:36:22	Fangs	idk if this is in tusko's sylabus, but that's also often a statement about prime ideals in rings
2021-08-31 08:36:34	Galois	and modular arithmetic is different enough from Z arithmetic that you want a rigorous grounding in the foundations of Z and N
2021-08-31 08:36:47	Galois	so that you know what parts of your intuition still hold in Zn, and what parts don't
2021-08-31 08:36:56	qergle	like you start of with this: defn an integer b is divisible by a non-zero integer a, if we have an integer x st b=ax. this is notated a|b.
2021-08-31 08:37:55	qergle	and then you go into the implications like a|b, b|c \implis a|c
2021-08-31 08:37:56	qergle	etc
2021-08-31 08:38:08	Galois	to put it more bluntly, if you assume "xy=1 ⇒ x=y=±1" without further understanding of the level below, then you're going to get in big trouble once you start doing arithmetic mod n, where this fact does NOT hold
2021-08-31 08:39:23	qergle	true. but don't you sometimes teach iteratively? like some lectures in you say "remember when we said xyz in lecture 1, well it's not always true, for example, here..."
2021-08-31 08:39:41	qergle	as opposed to front-loading the entirety of the foundation
2021-08-31 08:39:49	Galois	I think that's ok, but it's more like you'd be backtracking in lecture 2 instead of in lecture 20
2021-08-31 08:40:23	Fangs	teaching aside, tusko you said that fact was obvious
2021-08-31 08:40:33	Fangs	so I assume you had some intuition on why its true
2021-08-31 08:40:42	Fangs	could you have formalized that intuition?
2021-08-31 08:41:10	Fangs	(I think discussion along this lines is more worthwile than fussing about what OP's course teach or not teach)
2021-08-31 08:41:11	qergle	if you coqify the class there's no getting around it from the start, i guess.
2021-08-31 08:41:38	Galois	I don't coqify my cryptography class, but you are expected to know the foundations
2021-08-31 08:41:41	qergle	you can't coqify a|b,b|a ⇒ a=±1b without going in a big deeper.
2021-08-31 08:41:55	Galois	yes, you need at least well ordering or induction
2021-08-31 08:41:57	qergle	s/big/bit
2021-08-31 08:42:28	Galois	if pedagogy doesn't motivate you, consider that most of the really successful cryptographers are highly skilled in math, including foundational math

2021-08-31 08:57:56	Nickssen	https://imgur.com/a/Y4B72jl    this is the problem. I have the exponents of singularity r= 1/2 and 5/2. I am only asked for one solution so I went with 1/2. I got the relation c_n  = -c_n-2   /   n(n-2) for n>2.....
2021-08-31 08:58:10	tusko	Galois, yes I thought you might say that
2021-08-31 08:58:26	Nickssen	But I cant figure how to give a generic term for c_n in order to give a frobenius solution

2021-08-31 09:09:35	cherim	It's a Bessel-type equation with solutions x^{3/2} J_1(x) and x^{3/2} Y_1(x)

2021-08-31 09:10:40	cherim	The first behaves as x^{5/2} near x=0, the second has logarithmic singularity
2021-08-31 09:10:58	Nickssen	luckily he only asks for 1 solution

2021-08-31 09:12:31	cherim	And you correctly get the recurrence that unfolds as 1, 1/(n(n-2)), 1/(n(n-2)(n-2)(n-4)),... or such, with two factorials growing in the denominator
2021-08-31 09:12:40	cherim	As they should in Bessel functions
2021-08-31 09:13:55	qergle	which is which?
2021-08-31 09:14:05	qergle	is J 1st and Y 2nd or vice versa?
2021-08-31 09:14:17	Nickssen	cherim, would r = 1/2 have a log singularity?
2021-08-31 09:14:23	Nickssen	That's the one I was working with :/
2021-08-31 09:14:52	cherim	J_1(x) ~x so the good one is certainly x^{5/2}

2021-08-31 09:26:26	cherim	If you want to express the solution in terms of the solution of the standard equation, find out what to do with y(x) to make it satisfy the standard equation

2021-09-01 18:19:30	gulzar	pikapika: in https://imgur.com/a/c1p7Bo6   , blue and green both are forming plane. One Outer, one inner. There is space all around. That's filled with water. If I do cross section of the cube and view from one direction it looks like this https://imgur.com/a/K3yY1iV
2021-09-01 18:19:42	pikapika	first step should be to of course take a negative of the second  vector
2021-09-01 18:19:47	pikapika	so both are parallel instead of anti parallel

2021-09-01 18:22:01	pikapika	I can see the brown plane now
2021-09-01 18:22:03	pikapika	in the second pic
2021-09-01 18:22:17	pikapika	so anyways yeah
2021-09-01 18:22:21	pikapika	pick any one point from a plane
2021-09-01 18:22:26	gulzar	it's a very small fine line
2021-09-01 18:22:29	pikapika	and then form this equation (r-a).n
2021-09-01 18:22:31	pikapika	and then form this equation (r-a).n=0
2021-09-01 18:22:43	[itchyjunk]	uh
2021-09-01 18:22:47	pikapika	a is the particular point, r is the general point (x,y,z), n is the normal
2021-09-01 18:22:48	[itchyjunk]	i got stuck in a step
2021-09-01 18:23:01	pikapika	this will yield the planes equation (an equation of the form ax+by+cz=0)
2021-09-01 18:23:09	pikapika	if a is negative, multiply the whole by -1
2021-09-01 18:23:21	pikapika	Now for each water particle compute its signed distance from either plane
2021-09-01 18:23:34	pikapika	if both distances are of opposite signs that means it is between the planes
2021-09-01 18:23:43	[itchyjunk]	my lhs looks like sqrt((u^2 + v^2) (a^2 + b^2)) and my rhs looks like sqrt(a^2 + b^2) sqrt(u^2 + v^2)
2021-09-01 18:23:49	pikapika	if both are negative, its on one side of both planes, if both positive, its on the other side
2021-09-01 18:23:52	pikapika	its like this
2021-09-01 18:24:07	pikapika	-- | -+ | ++
2021-09-01 18:24:14	pikapika	where the vertical bars denote the planes
2021-09-01 18:24:16	[itchyjunk]	for sqrt(xy), when is it equals to sqrt(x) sqrt(y), i needed both x and y to be positive right?
2021-09-01 18:24:19	[itchyjunk]	then the property holds?
2021-09-01 18:24:24	gulzar	pikapika: the normal I have with cross product is that correct?
2021-09-01 18:24:30	pikapika	and the signs, well the signs of the distances of a water particle situated in that region from each plane
2021-09-01 18:24:40	pikapika	gulzar, both seem to point to the same direction
2021-09-01 18:24:57	pikapika	but also as I said, if there is a large number of points for each plane
2021-09-01 18:25:06	pikapika	it might be better to use some least squares technique to compute the normal
2021-09-01 18:25:07	pikapika	but anyways
2021-09-01 18:25:14	pikapika	assuming you have the plane normals and equations
2021-09-01 18:25:18	pikapika	the procedure is as I have outlined

2021-09-01 18:26:25	gulzar	i understood the logic of signed distance. will look for the formula pikapika
2021-09-01 18:26:29	[itchyjunk]	buster, i can almost prove it minus that one proprty of sqrt i am not 100% about
2021-09-01 18:26:39	gulzar	pikapika: what's with this least squared tech
2021-09-01 18:26:47	pikapika	gulzar, https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/9efdc616072ef4a4b360be791ad915cee59bfed0
2021-09-01 18:27:17	pikapika	gulzar, least squares is a way to fit a solution when there are more data points than unknowns
2021-09-01 18:27:39	pikapika	A plane as you note can be computed from three points
2021-09-01 18:27:54	pikapika	However you have more points available for your plane, so you might want to do a least squares fit
2021-09-01 18:27:59	int-e	[itchyjunk]: you're almost certainly making this too complicated. start with |uv| = |u||v|...
2021-09-01 18:28:37	[itchyjunk]	i assumed z = (a + ib) , w = (u+iv) and computed the things
2021-09-01 18:28:48	[itchyjunk]	i get that thing above
2021-09-01 18:28:53	[itchyjunk]	 my lhs looks like sqrt((u^2 + v^2) (a^2 + b^2)) and my rhs looks like sqrt(a^2 + b^2) sqrt(u^2 + v^2)
2021-09-01 18:28:55	riv	if xy are real and positive then yes sqrt(xy) = sqrt(x) sqrt(y)
2021-09-01 18:29:08	gulzar	pikapika: what will that give me?    As of now the worst case is that both the planes and normal are on either end of each other.
2021-09-01 18:29:17	pikapika	gulzar, and remember you have to first normalize the two equations before the signed distance computation
2021-09-01 18:29:18	[itchyjunk]	ah so both real and positives were necessary! think i vaguely remember thing
2021-09-01 18:29:32	int-e	[itchyjunk]: oh I'm probably confused about which problem you're tackling right now
2021-09-01 18:29:34	pikapika	ie choose a sign convention
2021-09-01 18:29:35	[itchyjunk]	i remember thinking it always held and int-e giving an example of it not holding
2021-09-01 18:29:36	riv	if they are both negative it fails
2021-09-01 18:29:48	riv	sqrt(-1 * -1) = sqrt(1) = 1
2021-09-01 18:29:56	riv	sqrt(-1) * sqrt(-1) = i * i = -1
2021-09-01 18:29:57	pikapika	gulzar, that will give you a normal that takes into account all the points, rather than just any three random points
2021-09-01 18:30:12	[itchyjunk]	int-e, https://ibb.co/J7BMfRw 4 d) but i didn't remember the property |uv| = |u||v| so was proving it in hopes of remembering it
2021-09-01 18:30:20	gulzar	pikapika: "choose" in the sense? If a is postiive for both then the way you told about signed dsitance should work?
2021-09-01 18:30:21	←	oxum has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2021-09-01 18:30:30	riv	if one is positive and one is negative it works too
2021-09-01 18:30:31	[itchyjunk]	riv, ah right. thats a nice example
2021-09-01 18:30:42	[itchyjunk]	oh it only fails when both negative?
2021-09-01 18:30:45	riv	yeah
2021-09-01 18:30:47	int-e	[itchyjunk]: ah. well, yes, you have sqrt(uv) = sqrt(u)sqrt(v) for *real* u,v >= 0
2021-09-01 18:30:47	[itchyjunk]	hadn't noticed!
2021-09-01 18:30:50	riv	why does it fail when both are negative
2021-09-01 18:30:53	int-e	[itchyjunk]: (different u and v)
2021-09-01 18:31:00	pikapika	gulzar, because ax+by+cz-d=0 and -ax-by-cz+d=0 are both the same equation
2021-09-01 18:31:11	pikapika	each will give opposing signed distances
2021-09-01 18:31:18	pikapika	so we have to choose a sign convention first
2021-09-01 18:31:24	[itchyjunk]	because i^2 = -1 ?
2021-09-01 18:31:28	pikapika	you could for example choose the convention that a is always positive
2021-09-01 18:31:39	pikapika	so if a is negative in your planes equation you multiply it whole by -1
2021-09-01 18:31:40	[itchyjunk]	something to do with i not caring about something
2021-09-01 18:31:41	riv	sqrt(z) is the inverse of z^2, z^2 doubles the argument(angle) of a complex number
2021-09-01 18:31:50	gulzar	ah ok, so if a is always positive then your logic works. That's enough for me
2021-09-01 18:31:52	riv	so sqrt halves the argument of a complex number
2021-09-01 18:32:07	gulzar	pikapika: so finally how to get the least quared normal?
2021-09-01 18:32:13	pikapika	I will have to look that up
2021-09-01 18:32:14	riv	but argument loops around, because it's an angle
2021-09-01 18:32:21	riv	so half of 0 is different to half of 2 pi
2021-09-01 18:32:22	int-e	[itchyjunk]: your sqrt((u^2 + v^2) (a^2 + b^2)) and sqrt(a^2 + b^2) sqrt(u^2 + v^2) only involve real numbers
2021-09-01 18:32:23	pikapika	But in the meanwhile you can use the normal from the random three points
2021-09-01 18:32:28	riv	even though 0 = 2 pi
2021-09-01 18:32:32	gulzar	pikapika: other way is if possible linear transformation of the point to the normal and then check the signed distance
2021-09-01 18:32:46	[itchyjunk]	int-e, right! in this case, they are equal and hence proved

2021-09-01 18:36:07	pikapika	gulzar, that depends on how well, planar your set of points is
2021-09-01 18:36:20	pikapika	if they are highly planar, any three random points should be good enough

Since f' exists then f is automatically continuous; since f'' exists, f' is automatically continuous. ... Since f^(n) exists, f^(n-1) is automatically continuous. To say f is in class C^n says that f^(n) exists *and* is continuous, so all of the above is automatic just from f^(n) existing.  f^(n) being also continuous is the one non-automatic thing here.

2021-09-01 20:47:59	Z-module	but really, you should keep in mind that a function f being differentiable (on say R) *only* really means that for each real x,   lim_{h -> 0} ((f(x + h) - f(x))/h   exists. It has nothing inherently to do with knowing a "formula" for f and doing a symbolic computation on that, to get a new formula that gives f' everywhere.

2021-09-01 22:09:04	greenbagels	the more conventional idea is that infinitely big numbers don't exist, but that there is no "biggest integer"
2021-09-01 22:09:13	blueberrycrop	greenbagels it's hard not to get philosophical about it

2021-09-02 10:07:22	Galois	you want a quotient q(x) and a remainder r(x), such that:
2021-09-02 10:07:29	Galois	1. f(x) = g(x) * q(x) + r(x)
2021-09-02 10:07:31	Galois	and
2021-09-02 10:07:36	Galois	2. degree of r(x) is as small as possible
2021-09-02 10:08:00	Galois	rewrite equation 1 as follows: r(x) = f(x) - g(x) * q(x)
2021-09-02 10:08:26	Galois	"eliminate" means: choose q(x) such that deg(f(x) - g(x) * q(x)) < deg(f(x))
2021-09-02 10:08:58	Galois	that's the first step. I mean, obviously, you can trivially obtain r(x) = f(x) just by setting q(x) = 0
2021-09-02 10:09:12	Guest7	ohhh
2021-09-02 10:09:26	Galois	so, to do any better than the trivial choice, you must arrange it so that the degree of r(x) is smaller than the degree of f(x)
2021-09-02 10:11:37	Galois	in your example, f(x) = 4x^3 + 2x^2 + x + 3 and g(x) = 2x + 1. By choosing q(x) = 2x^2, you obtain r(x) = f(x) - g(x) * q(x) = x + 3, which has degree smaller than the degree of f(x)
2021-09-02 10:12:19	Galois	in this case, you can do better than that, but that's the first step. To do better, the idea is simple: just take r(x) as your "new" f(x)
2021-09-02 10:12:33	→	kakuhen has joined ##math
2021-09-02 10:13:58	Galois	You keep going until deg(r(x)) < deg(g(x)). Once you reach that point, you stop, because you can't reduce deg(r(x)) any further.
2021-09-02 10:14:32	loopspace	The "purpose of polynomial division" is not "to show that polynomials form a Euclidean domain in the first place"
2021-09-02 10:14:39	Galois	it may be the case that deg(f(x)) < deg(g(x)) from the start. In this case, you can't do any better than the trivial solution q(x) = 0 and r(x) = f(x)
2021-09-02 10:14:57	Galois	ignore loopspace, he/she/it is not only ignorant of math but ignorant of what they don't know

The problem here is that no matter what integer k is, this expression gives the same single complex value. What you *should* have said is   e^((pi/3 + (2pi/3)k) i)   for all k.

2021-09-05 21:00:11	cadmio	riv: no it isn't
2021-09-05 21:01:27	riv	right! so (1 2 3) is not conjugate to (1 3 2) in A_3
2021-09-05 21:01:35	riv	even though it is conjugate in S_3
2021-09-05 21:01:47	cadmio	this means that there could be fewer classes than 4 in A_5, isn't it?
2021-09-05 21:01:54	Z-module	more, not fewer
2021-09-05 21:02:14	riv	cadmio, Do you agree that (1 2 3) is not conjugate to (1 3 2) in A_3?

2021-09-05 21:02:42	cadmio	riv: yes I do

2021-09-05 21:11:06	cadmio	I think the text doesn't want to use that method but rather consider conjugacy a group action and calculate the orbit size
2021-09-05 21:11:25	riv	sounds good, give it a try
2021-09-05 21:11:44	Z-module	so for that you'll need to find stabilizers (in A_5) of particular elements
2021-09-05 21:12:08	Z-module	group theory is all about strategically placed propellers
2021-09-05 21:12:19	Z-module	and gyroscopes

2021-09-06 11:22:23	W	ant, a polynomial can be factored by its roots, but one rot might correspond to more than one factor, so e.g. x^2-2x+1=(x-1)(x-1), because it has just one solution, x=1, but it's double - but that's just one possibility, what is the context?

2021-09-06 11:24:59	W	yeah, it's basically the same thing, but probably the reverse idea; if the discriminant is positive, there's two real solutions (if it's 0 there's one, as in the equation I used as example)
2021-09-06 11:25:45	ant	Ah, I get it now, thanks :)
2021-09-06 11:26:59	W	(and if it's negative, you have to go to the complex numbers and there's two again there, thus the qualifying "real")

2021-09-07 19:06:34	theskillwithin	programming is engineering, altho theres less math involved usually

2021-09-07 19:08:35	[itchyjunk]	you learn set theory, pick up Coq and realize sets is the wrong way to think
2021-09-07 19:08:39	[itchyjunk]	to do math on computer
2021-09-07 19:08:47	[itchyjunk]	then you are like weeeel sheeeet
2021-09-07 19:08:52	greenbagels	[itchyjunk]: do you recall this fact from precalculus: if a polynomial with real coefficients has a complex root, it necessarily also has the conjugate root?
2021-09-07 19:09:22	[itchyjunk]	i do not
2021-09-07 19:09:24	[itchyjunk]	hmm
2021-09-07 19:09:59	cafkafk	Set theory is still worthwhile for algorithms for instance
2021-09-07 19:10:01	[itchyjunk]	but he'll cover this topic today so i'll be reminded of all of this soon enough
2021-09-07 19:10:20	[itchyjunk]	you can implement some algos in terms of set theory
2021-09-07 19:10:27	[itchyjunk]	but from what i hear, type theory makes more sense?
2021-09-07 19:10:30	[itchyjunk]	idk how true that is
2021-09-07 19:10:40	[itchyjunk]	hard to find lot of type theory experts to ask a lot of questions
2021-09-07 19:11:58	theskillwithin	set theory can get existential right? like in godel escher bach
2021-09-07 19:12:04	greenbagels	[itchyjunk]: alternatively, think about how factoring a polynomial over C differs than that over R
2021-09-07 19:12:07	Guest71	https://i.imgur.com/R1dM496.png The first step for me is to find dy/dx. That means: -sin^(-2)(x) - sin^(-2)(y(x)) * dy/dx = 0 and then we solve for "dy/dx" ?
2021-09-07 19:12:40	greenbagels	as in, z^4-4 is easily factorable into (z^2+2)(z^2-2) over R; why can't z^4+4 be done this way?
2021-09-07 19:12:45	[itchyjunk]	greenbagels, not too fimiliar with factoring in C. but in R, iirc, i could long division
2021-09-07 19:12:47	greenbagels	and does this situation change in C?

2021-09-07 19:13:06	[itchyjunk]	is it because of the i's? hmm let me think about this
2021-09-07 19:13:15	greenbagels	long division works if you want to divide by a root, like they';ve given you; but i think you can honestly factor it without them giving you any info
2021-09-07 19:13:16	FriendlyPigeon	Hello, is it ok to ask a question about homework?

2021-09-07 19:28:16	[itchyjunk]	FriendlyPigeon, by having experience in it
2021-09-07 19:28:18	FriendlyPigeon	Like is there a way to plug {x^2 | x ∈ Z} into wolfram alpha or such to see what it looks like
2021-09-07 19:28:24	[itchyjunk]	or refrencing some stuff like books and google
2021-09-07 19:28:32	[itchyjunk]	yes
2021-09-07 19:28:34	tolarz	There is this notation {e(x) | x ∈ A} which maps all elements x ∈ A to e(x)
2021-09-07 19:28:36	FriendlyPigeon	Or any other tool to play with stuff to see what it looks like

2021-09-07 19:33:54	FriendlyPigeon	so I had trouble with it
2021-09-07 19:34:02	cherim	For the taxi driver?
2021-09-07 19:34:31	[itchyjunk]	greenbagels, i am in an applied math class this time :(
2021-09-07 19:34:36	[itchyjunk]	fields, rings etc dont exist
2021-09-07 19:34:49	cherim	My example was "do the same as in Markov chain, except when you are at A and just came from a hotel. Then return to the same hotel"
2021-09-07 19:35:39	CuriousErnestBro	cherim the taxi driver picks up 2 people with probability pi and 1 person with probability 1-pi, then he wrote down the 4 possible routes the taxi driver can take, and he solved it for first-order probabilities to get pi, and showed that it violates the markov property.
2021-09-07 19:36:11	greenbagels	[itchyjunk]: ok well the takeaway is like, back in Reals Land you could take something like x^4-4 and say "well let's just treat x^2 as our unknown, maybe call it y; then we have y^2-4 which is (y+2)(y-2) = (x^2+2)(x^2-2)"
2021-09-07 19:36:15	cherim	Looks overcomplicated compared to mine
2021-09-07 19:36:19	CuriousErnestBro	yes
2021-09-07 19:36:23	FriendlyPigeon	is  A × B − B × A just ∅
2021-09-07 19:36:27	CuriousErnestBro	yours is better imo\
2021-09-07 19:36:43	[itchyjunk]	right
2021-09-07 19:36:45	FriendlyPigeon	with this "cartesian product" bit
2021-09-07 19:36:49	[itchyjunk]	the real land makes sense
2021-09-07 19:36:57	greenbagels	if you combine this trick with the trick that a^2+b^2=(a+bi)(a-bi), you now can simplify x^4+4, too
2021-09-07 19:37:09	greenbagels	at least, into quadratic factors
2021-09-07 19:37:10	[itchyjunk]	FriendlyPigeon, i don't think that's always true
2021-09-07 19:37:18	greenbagels	then you'll have to do some legwork to simplify it into linear factors
2021-09-07 19:37:21	FriendlyPigeon	Let A = {1, 2, 3, 4} and B = {1, 2}

2021-09-08 15:38:37	int-e	Fohsap: It's just a bunch of arithmetic manipulation. Say, 80 is missing 20 to reach 100, and 20 is 25% of 80.
2021-09-08 15:39:17	int-e	The reason that I stress the 80%*125% form is that it's purely percentages; no "decrease" nor "increase" in there.
2021-09-08 15:39:55	int-e	So it separates those concepts from the multiplication that explains why one compensates for the other.
2021-09-08 15:40:54	cadmio	qergle: and Z_n is abelian, so it's just the corollary of the fundamental homomorpshim theorem

2021-09-08 15:45:08	int-e	Fohsap: complementing this it may be worth seeing what happens when an x% decrease is followed by an x% increase (or vice versa): (1 - x/100)(1 + x/100) = 1 - x^2/10000. So if x is small that's close (but not equal) to 1. For x=10 you get 90%*110% = 99%, so that's often close enough. For x = 50 you get 50% * 150% = 75% which is usually not okay.

2021-09-08 17:56:33	rubiksdream	kinda stuck on filling in the details for this: Let D be a domain (open+connected subset) of C, let E \subset D be compact, show that there is some constant M > 0 depending only on E and D, such that every nonnegative harmonic function u : D -> R_{>=0} satisfies u(z_1) <= M u(z_2) for any z_1,z_2 \in E
2021-09-08 17:57:33	rubiksdream	so far I can show that there is some finite covering of E by balls B_i (say of radius r_i, centered at z_i) and a constant C > 0 s.t. as long as z_1,z_2 are inside one of these balls, and in E, we get u(z_1) <= C u(z_2)
2021-09-08 17:58:03	rubiksdream	but im struggling to extend this to the result I actually want, i.e. go from here to *any* z_1,z_2 (not necessarily in the same ball)
2021-09-08 17:59:56	rubiksdream	i think given E is path connected, i could prove this and change the constant to (number of balls)*C
2021-09-08 18:00:01	rubiksdream	(or something like that)

There are examples of pseudo-metrics, i.e. maps d : X x X  -> R_{>=0} that satisfies the triangle inequality, symmetry, but do not satisfy d(x,y) = 0 iff x = y, e.g. take the space of integrable functions on [0,1], and define d(f,g) = int |f-g|, this is a pseudo-metric, and it induces a topology where the open sets are unions of balls

2021-09-08 22:29:34	Guest76	I think it's fine. I don't care what it looks like really. This proof is also in Tao's book, I was more concerned about the whole setup thing rather than the arithmetic derivation thing.

2021-09-08 22:46:33	greenbagels	Simplar: that probably works; if you know how planar equations work you can define it as the vector that (possibly uniquely) solves the equation (plane_equation = line_equation) or something

2021-09-09 17:18:43	buster	you find that the four roots come in complex-conjugate pairs
2021-09-09 17:19:06	[itchyjunk]	hmm 1 sec i'll compute the 4 roots at this point then

2021-09-09 17:21:14	pikapika	oh he already said that
2021-09-09 17:21:21	pikapika	so yeah you already have two roots due to the conjugate rule
2021-09-09 17:21:34	pikapika	now you can divide it by that quadratic and solve the quotient to get the remaining roots
2021-09-09 17:22:13	buster	you're given that 1+i is a root, and it follows that 1-i is another, and then that z²-2z+2 is a factor. Then you can do long division to find the other. But the thing you have started to do using roots of unity is another reasonable way to find the other factor, too.
2021-09-09 17:24:16	pikapika	yeah its a good trick for this equation
2021-09-09 17:24:20	buster	it's special to this particular case, though. it wouldn't help much if you started with z⁴+2z²+1=0

2021-09-09 21:21:39	enoq	yeah, makes sense

2021-09-09 21:29:17	qergle	ok, but here an outcome is of the form (x,y) where x=die 1 and y=die 2
2021-09-09 21:29:30	qergle	that's why we have 400 of them
2021-09-09 21:29:37	enoq	ah, I misunderstood
2021-09-09 21:30:08	enoq	so basically if one die exceeds it, the other one is irrelevant
2021-09-09 21:30:20	qergle	for my event question, yes
2021-09-09 21:30:21	enoq	then there's also the case where both are the same
2021-09-09 21:30:38	enoq	so there are 5 cases where both die rolls are the same

2021-09-09 21:32:18	qergle	so how many ways are there where they both exceed 15?
2021-09-09 21:33:17	enoq	first though that comes to mind would be 5*5
2021-09-09 21:33:27	qergle	and that's right
2021-09-09 21:33:34	enoq	all permutations kinda
2021-09-09 21:33:50	enoq	so we subtract that
2021-09-09 21:34:01	qergle	so the total number of outcomes favorable to at least one die exceeds 15 is: 2*5*20 - 5*5 = 175 (out of 400) is 7/16
2021-09-09 21:34:35	qergle	which is the same as realizing that P(A ∪ B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A ∩ B)

2021-09-09 21:38:40	enoq	since we don't disregard the second die, right?
2021-09-09 21:38:45	qergle	what's an example of both dice being at or below the target?
2021-09-09 21:39:02	qergle	(14,8) is one, right?
2021-09-09 21:39:10	enoq	so we want to multiply by 15 instead of 20 I think
2021-09-09 21:39:22	enoq	since the failing cases of either die go from 1-15
2021-09-09 21:39:26	qergle	right, there are 15^2 outcomes favorable to that
2021-09-09 21:39:50	enoq	ah, you're right
2021-09-09 21:39:57	qergle	so 1-15^2/400 should be the same as (2*5*20 - 5*5)/400

2021-09-09 21:51:13	qergle	but if you do the math, the probability of getting a 15 (or higher) in 2d20 is actually better than even odds (more than 50%)

2021-09-09 22:33:27	nagefire	with these tests, your tolerance is +-0.5

For the variance you said "D=sum_x p[x] (x-X)^2". How do I read that? I did x minus samplemean, squared that, summed it up and got 30,352,754. From here on out I did a lot of things, none of which seem correct. https://i.imgur.com/GUEuxmo.png  As I understand it should now be

2021-09-10 20:13:05	Z-module	their point here is merely that the image f([-1,1]) is a subset of [-1/3, 0]   so f sends the domain into itself

2021-09-10 23:44:13	→	hanif has joined ##math
2021-09-10 23:44:26	cuppajoeman	For example, I think this works for vectors, real numbers and complex numbers, but is there a general way to say it?
2021-09-10 23:46:09	somiaj	well if you define it as you did, you need anything in which has addition and scalar multiplication defined
2021-09-10 23:46:25	←	savask has left ##math

2021-09-10 23:48:04	somiaj	but any vector field over R works, since real numbers and complex numbers can also be viewed as vector fields over R (so can functions)
2021-09-10 23:48:19	somiaj	so your three examples are really all the same thing, vector fields over R
2021-09-10 23:49:29	cuppajoeman	Oh ok, I also kept looking and I found field, is that more relaxed?
2021-09-10 23:49:43	somiaj	field would be more limted
2021-09-10 23:50:11	somiaj	by more relaxed, I was thinking you could still define that function without say addition bing commulitive, or various things like that
2021-09-10 23:50:40	somiaj	or maybe you are only in a ring, but in general I think vector field is a good place to be at, and not worry about what happens if you relax some of the axioms
2021-09-10 23:51:04	somiaj	cuppajoeman: arg, I'm using bad termonology, it is 'vector space', not 'vector field' -- that is something different
2021-09-10 23:51:13	cuppajoeman	Ok, I'll start with vector space
2021-09-10 23:51:20	cuppajoeman	thank you!
2021-09-10 23:51:28	somiaj	cuppajoeman: a vector space is a field + another set of vectors, in which vector addition and scalar multiplicaiton is defined with additional axioms

2021-09-10 23:53:03	somiaj	It would also work for vector fields over C, but I assume you want to restrict t to be real.

2021-09-10 23:54:40	somiaj	It wouldn't, it just wouldn't be as general
2021-09-10 23:54:49	cuppajoeman	Because then I couldn't talk about vectors right?
2021-09-10 23:55:02	→	trace987 has joined ##math
2021-09-10 23:55:18	somiaj	Right, you couldn't say have this be a line in R^3 where x = <1,2,-1> and y = <3,0,-2>
2021-09-10 23:55:29	→	kapil has joined ##math
2021-09-10 23:55:52	somiaj	and since real numbers are a 1D vector space over themselves, you just get more possibilties (more general) than only allowing x and y to be real numbers.
2021-09-10 23:56:02	cuppajoeman	Because the set of vectors in R^3 don't make a field right?
2021-09-10 23:56:20	somiaj	correct, because only addition is defined in R^3
2021-09-10 23:56:31	somiaj	but if you have it as a vector space, then you have addition and scalar multiplication defined

2021-09-10 23:57:40	cuppajoeman	right
2021-09-10 23:57:44	somiaj	that is part of the axioms for a field, also have to hvae identiy elements, and inverse elemnts

2021-09-11 00:12:06	greenbagels	cuppajoeman: right? :)
2021-09-11 00:12:52	p-i-_	I thought about bounding hypercubes/hypersphers and finding the axis that maximizes distance
2021-09-11 00:13:34	int-e	p-i-_: (though in 2D you can discard points inside the convex hull; that's not attractive in 128 dimensions)
2021-09-11 00:14:03	greenbagels	is this one of those problems where once you go to 3D and beyond the same issues cause problems
2021-09-11 00:14:23	cuppajoeman	I want to make a bijection between (-pi/2, pi/2) to [0,1]. In general I have an idea about how I can make a bijection between two open sets like (a,b) <-> (c,d), but I'm not too sure how to proceed for (a,b) <-> [c,d] like in this example.
2021-09-11 00:14:35	p-i-_	I imagined a scenario of 3 galaxies where you can bound-sphere around each. Big separation between galaxies. So only triangles with one point in each would be valid.

2021-09-11 00:16:38	int-e	Okay, the 2D case is actually easy... compute the convex hull, then walk around it once to find the maximum (keeping track of two vectors about 90 degrees apart as viewed from A)
2021-09-11 00:16:40	cuppajoeman	so new idea altogether?
2021-09-11 00:16:54	somiaj	cuppajoeman: now one example [a,b] -> (c,d) is use that linear function (almost)

2021-09-11 00:17:11	int-e	(that description is very sketchy, but it will work out)

2021-09-11 00:17:48	p-i-_	So a 3D space will have a convex hull of planes.
2021-09-11 00:17:51	somiaj	cuppajoeman: so let l: [a,b] -> [c,d] be your linear function, now to make a bijection from [a,b] -> (c,d) we need to be a little tricy

2021-09-11 00:19:54	p-i-_	I think dot-product formulation of triangle area could be vectorized so the problem can be expressed in matrix operations.
2021-09-11 00:20:34	somiaj	cuppajoeman: I was thinking [0,1], let h = b-a, then send a -> f(a + h/2), f^-1(a + h/2) -> f(a + h/4), and so on (so what I'm doing is basically taking a set of points 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16, .... out of the function and sending them to the next one in the list, dealing with the end point, do a similar thing to b, and this will now get a bijection from [a,b] -> (c,d) -- that make sense or am I making it too

2021-09-11 00:23:00	cuppajoeman	right
2021-09-11 00:23:35	somiaj	basically you just remove a countable number of points from the linear function, and then send x_n -> x_n+1 in that countable infinite list, to deal with the end point

2021-09-12 12:42:52	Codaraxis	W, Fair enough. I started out with an optimization problem. I have an earning rate and I have a set of technologies. Each technology has an associated cost and an amount by which it increases the earning rate. Each time a unit of a technology is purchased, the cost of that technology increases but the amount by which it increases the earning rate does not.

2021-09-16 18:27:01	[itchyjunk]	oh sin never goes negative between (0,pi)
2021-09-16 18:27:08	[itchyjunk]	is that it?
2021-09-16 18:27:40	kobalt	yes it is +ve in the first quadrant
2021-09-16 18:28:32	[itchyjunk]	Let me rewrite it and see if you buy it. f(z) =  cos(t) (r+r^-1) + i sin(t) (r-r^-1). for t \in (0,pi),  cos(t) (r+r^-1) + i sin(t) (r-r^-1) is always positive so this implies image is always in the upper half of plane.

2021-09-16 18:30:28	Vornicus	I'm using "probability" because it lets me ignore things like "count permutations"
2021-09-16 18:30:50	Vornicus	I can simplify the situation down to "what fraction of situations will pull this off"
2021-09-16 18:31:29	kobalt	Vornicus: is this problem difficult for an undergraduate
2021-09-16 18:32:03	Vornicus	the most difficult part really was 1. figuring out waht they mean and 2. not falling into the trap of actually trying to count permutations

2021-09-17 15:42:19	int-e	Y could be: pick a uniformly random real number in [0,1) (so *that* is your probability space). Multiply it by 6, add 1, and truncate the result to an integer.
2021-09-17 15:42:20	CuriousErnestBro	so I'd say the sigma algebra is the same too
2021-09-17 15:42:46	CuriousErnestBro	uhhhh that's not a probability space
2021-09-17 15:43:30	int-e	And then the smallest sigma algebra you get for Y is generated by [0,1/6), [1/6,1/3), [1/3,1/2), [1/2,2/3), [2/3,5/6), [5/6,1)

2021-09-17 16:05:28	int-e	tau commutes with (1 2) <--> the conjugate (1 2)^-1 tau (1 2) is equal to tau. Which is useful because conjugation operates nicely on cycle representation of permutations...
2021-09-17 16:05:41	cadmio	so if they are disjoint they must commute
2021-09-17 16:07:22	Z-module	right, more generally if s and t are any two elements of S_n where neither one moves any sybmol moved by the other, then st = ts

2021-09-17 18:31:20	isekaijin	Of course, it suffices to show that the generators of L as a K-algebra are algebraic over K.

2021-09-17 18:33:18	→	daoudr_ has joined ##math
2021-09-17 18:35:23	isekaijin	So I am trying to prove it by contradiction. If x1,...,xn are the generators of L as a K-algebra, then clearly I may assume that the first generator x1 is transcendent over K. (If x1,...,xr are algebraic, then F = K[x1,...,xr] is a finite algebraic extension of K, and then I only need to show that L/F is a finite algebraic extension as well.)
2021-09-17 18:36:02	isekaijin	(Where L = F[x{r+1},...,xn], of course.)

2021-09-17 18:37:47	Z-module	Wait, is Q(pi) not finitely generated over Q as a Q-algebra?
2021-09-17 18:37:57	isekaijin	Q(pi) is not the same thing as Q[pi].
2021-09-17 18:38:05	Z-module	oh right
2021-09-17 18:39:26	isekaijin	To clarify the issues that may arise, let's fix small values of n.
2021-09-17 18:39:54	kobalt	qergle: There should be 80 numbers that has all evel digits and sum equal or greater than 10.
2021-09-17 18:40:04	isekaijin	If n = 0, there is nothing to show. If n = 1, then L = K[x1] is a field if and only if x1 is algebraic over K, because otherwise L is the polynomial ring.
2021-09-17 18:41:42	isekaijin	If n = 2, then assume by contradiction that K[x1] is the polynomial ring. Then K[x1] contains infinitely many non-associated irreducible polynomials, inverses of which a simple extension K[x1,x2] cannot simultaneously add.
2021-09-17 18:42:09	←	daoudr_ has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2021-09-17 18:42:20	isekaijin	So the issues start with n = 3.
2021-09-17 18:43:09	qergle	kobalt: that's a separate problem, though, right?
2021-09-17 18:44:51	qergle	unless you and int-e moved on to a variation, i just joined and am sort of tired (was going by the image linked)
2021-09-17 18:45:59	isekaijin	Actually, I just noticed that I may assume that all generators (not just the first one) are transcendent over K. For otherwise reorder the generators and voilà.
2021-09-17 18:47:11	isekaijin	I guess there is a maximal number of algebraically independent generators too. But this is starting to get suspiciously close to Noether normalization territory.
2021-09-17 18:47:43	kobalt	qergle: actually the solution of the problem seems like all the digits should be distinct. I want to solve both the cases with distinct digits and repeating digits.
2021-09-17 18:48:17	kobalt	for now I we are solving the case with repeating digits.
2021-09-17 18:48:29	qergle	the image linked doesn't say all digits different
2021-09-17 18:49:35	kobalt	yes but the solution goes like this https://i.imgur.com/k1P0ixp.png

2021-09-17 19:05:26	isekaijin	Thanks.
2021-09-17 19:08:59	qergle	int-e / kobalt the only plausible way to read it that way is with the weird "from the digits" as in selecting without replacement.
2021-09-17 19:09:23	qergle	but i would state that explicitely because this read is a stretch
2021-09-17 19:13:40	kobalt	yes. maths problems should not be ambiguous.

2021-09-17 19:27:09	isekaijin	Reading this proof of Zariski exposed a psychological limitation in the way I come up with inductive proofs.
2021-09-17 19:27:20	isekaijin	I was expecting the proof to look like “First we show xn is integral over R = K[x1,...,x{n-1}]. Since L, a field, is an integral extension of R, we conclude that R is a field. By induction on n, R/K is an algebraic extension. Therefore, so is L/K.”
2021-09-17 19:27:58	isekaijin	Notice that I only used the inductive hypothesis near the end.
2021-09-17 19:29:15	kobalt	so I counted that there are 111 numbers with one odd and two even digits that may repeat such that the sum is greater than 10
2021-09-17 19:29:30	isekaijin	Instead, Zariski uses the inductive hypothesis as his first step: L = K(x1)[x2,...,xn] is algebraic over K(x1). And only then he shows that x1 is algebraic over K, thereby establishing that K(x1) = K[x1].
2021-09-17 19:31:49	int-e	kobalt: my computer disagrees. Meanwhile I'm wondering why you even care about a case with an odd digit sum.
2021-09-17 19:32:51	kobalt	sorry i mistyped, two odd and one even digit.
2021-09-17 19:33:51	qergle	not 250?
2021-09-17 19:35:18	int-e	qergle: funny, I'm getting 260

2021-09-17 19:35:54	int-e	and is it > 10 rather than >= 10
2021-09-17 19:36:02	riv	it could be solved with a computer program that just checks numbers

2021-09-17 19:50:14	isekaijin	[itchyjunk]: There is a proof that pi is transcendental, which is an even stronger property than being irrational.

2021-09-17 19:50:56	[itchyjunk]	transcendental just means non algebriac ?
2021-09-17 19:51:20	isekaijin	Yes, and algebraic means that it is the solution of a polynomial equation with integer coefficients (not necessarily monic).
2021-09-17 19:51:30	kobalt	i have heard somewhere that transcedental numbers are bad.

2021-09-17 23:29:43	somiaj	Julian: does coarser mean more or less edges?
2021-09-17 23:30:27	Juliu	I mean like I could represent each cycle in the graph with a node and connect it to everything the cycle is connected to. That way you get a coarser version
2021-09-17 23:30:50	Juliu	But this only seems to work for certain graphs, for example planar graphs maybe
2021-09-17 23:30:53	somiaj	As your question states you just need to know the answer to my question, then you can either add or take away edges, that easy
2021-09-17 23:30:56	←	riv has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2021-09-17 23:31:05	somiaj	what is your definition of a coarser graph?
2021-09-17 23:31:13	Juliu	If you do that for a graph that forms a tetraeder, you'll get a new tetraeder, so nothing coarser sadly
2021-09-17 23:31:56	Juliu	I'd like a graph with less nodes where each node represents a set of nodes in the old graph. And the new node should of course be connected to everything the old nodes were connected to as well
2021-09-17 23:32:54	→	riv has joined ##math
2021-09-17 23:33:01	somiaj	so maybe if you have a subgraph that is an equivalence relation, represent each equivalence class as a single node?
2021-09-17 23:34:00	somiaj	so something like let G1 subgraph of G be an equivalence relation of maximal size, then turn all equivalence classes into a single node?
2021-09-17 23:34:23	Juliu	I have a graph given and I'd like a coarser version of that graph
2021-09-17 23:35:14	somiaj	Just making a graph coarser or finer is easy, just add/subtract edges. But it seems that you had additional conditions, so make those conditions clear.
2021-09-17 23:35:44	Juliu	For example if the given graph is two cycles that are connected, then a coarser version could maybe be just to represent each cycle by a node and connect those 2 nodes with an edge
2021-09-17 23:36:06	somiaj	My last comments were about your statement, "I'd like a graph...." and to me equivalence classes seemed natural for that
2021-09-17 23:36:13	Juliu	I somehow want to get rid of cycles
2021-09-17 23:36:39	Juliu	It's just a graph. Nothing with equivalance classes or stuff like that
2021-09-17 23:37:46	somiaj	just getting rid of cycles maybe a bit more problematic which is why I suggested thinking of it as an equivalence relation. For instance if you had two cycles a->b->c->d->a and a->b->e->f->a how would you get rid of those two? Do you want those to be two distinct nodes in your new graph?
2021-09-17 23:39:00	somiaj	I know it is just a graph, but all graphs can be viewed as relations on the nodes, and since they are already symmetric, you just need transitive to have an equivalence class, so to me it seemed to be a natural way to condense multiple nodes into a single node

2021-09-17 23:39:29	→	plasticmae has joined ##math
2021-09-17 23:39:42	somiaj	I guess they are actually antireflexive relations, but you could assume reflexivitivty for this.
2021-09-17 23:40:26	somiaj	note cycles may not be transitive with all points in the node, so you are just thinking of a bit weaker version of what I was suggesting.
2021-09-17 23:40:59	somiaj	but because cycles may not make all the points transitive, this leads to the example I pointed out above you'd have to decide what to do with it.

2021-09-17 23:43:46	Juliu	somiaj, yes, I'd like 2 distinct nodes in the new graph for your example
2021-09-17 23:43:50	Juliu	I think
2021-09-17 23:45:39	somiaj	The problem with using cycles vs equivalence classes is deciding what the new nodes are going to be, but I think you do have a good idea of what you want, you just need to decide what to do about it
2021-09-17 23:46:00	somiaj	but sounds like you want to turn each distinct cycle into a single node, and connect it to any node (not in the cycle) any node in the cycle is connected to
2021-09-17 23:46:10	Juliu	I wonder if you do what I explained, represent each cycle in the old graph with a node in the new graph, and then repeat this iteratively, for what connected graphs does this result in a single node?
2021-09-17 23:47:47	Juliu	somiaj, yes, indeed, that is what I meant. Or to be more precise, connect two new nodes in case one of the node they represent is connected with one of the nodes the other new node represents
2021-09-17 23:48:12	←	TechTest has quit (Quit: Connection closed for inactivity)
2021-09-17 23:48:46	somiaj	the other issue I see with doing this with cycles over equivalence classes is you will destroy some info about the graph, which you maybe okay with
2021-09-17 23:51:04	Juliu	Of course a coarser graph contains less information, that's no problem :)
2021-09-17 23:54:13	somiaj	yup, but if you knew what the equivalence classes were in the original graph + new graph in my original suggestion, you could rebuild the original graph.
2021-09-17 23:54:22	Juliu	I want to know for what kind of connected graphs this procedure leads to a single node if you iterate it

2021-09-18 15:24:17	Gurkenglas	It seems that instead of defining categories as "A path of X induces one X" and then functors as "An X induces a Y such that all diagrams commute", I can define functors as "A path of X induces one Y" and then categories, if I ever need them, as a special functor. Is there a word for this approach?

2021-09-18 15:35:13	Gurkenglas	A category lets you compose a path of arrows into one arrow. Associativity and unitality are both covered by "all ways to do this come out the same way".
2021-09-18 15:36:55	riv	hmm
2021-09-18 15:37:45	riv	so what does a path of X mean
2021-09-18 15:37:52	Gurkenglas	to put it in context, this approach would define a function as "An X induces one Y"
2021-09-18 15:38:12	riv	this just seems obtuse
2021-09-18 15:38:25	riv	just call them morphisms
2021-09-18 15:38:27	Gurkenglas	An arrow has a source and a target. A path of arrows is a finite sequence of arrows that has each target equal to the next source

2021-09-18 15:39:20	Gurkenglas	it's a morphism without there necessarily already being a notion of composition.
2021-09-18 15:39:41	riv	seems like a weird thing to say
2021-09-18 15:40:15	riv	morphisms come before composition in normal category theory
2021-09-18 15:41:05	Gurkenglas	I mean, what to name em isn't the hill for me to die on :) sure we can call them morphisms.
2021-09-18 15:42:05	riv	you were saying that calling them a path implies composition axioms
2021-09-18 15:42:33	Gurkenglas	no i didnt
2021-09-18 15:43:15	riv	ok
2021-09-18 15:43:57	Gurkenglas	i see your interpretation now, though. a function is a witness of "for all X there exists a Y" and a functor is a witness of "for all paths of X there exists a Y".
2021-09-18 15:45:58	Gurkenglas	calling them a path implies that sources and targets match. note that there is a canonical category of "paths of morphisms".

2021-09-18 23:09:31	Forlorn	Proof by contradiction: if it was equal to any other element in this sequence, more precisely 3•2 = 1•2^m, where 0<m<4,
2021-09-18 23:09:33	Forlorn	then since 3=1•2^3, that means, 2^3•2 = 2^4 = 2^m•2^n = 2^m where 0 < n < 4 (since we can do that rewrite). If this is true, it must mean that 2^n = 1. Contradiction. Hence we exhaust all options, and the only one remaining is the identity action, that is 2^4 = 1.

2021-09-19 01:22:23	[itchyjunk]	right so the size of pizza slice grown as n grows right?
2021-09-19 01:22:29	[itchyjunk]	nothing else changes with these mappings

2021-09-19 01:33:06	brownorange	so the universal set cannot exist in ZFC?
2021-09-19 01:33:39	riv	yes no set of all sets
2021-09-19 01:34:31	brownorange	and the solution was disallowing that to make ZFC better than naive set theory?
2021-09-19 01:35:45	riv	yes
2021-09-19 01:36:41	brownorange	then a similar solution might be productive for the incompleteness of math. i know that's a big claim, but it's worth trying
2021-09-19 01:37:30	riv	no

2021-09-19 01:37:48	brownorange	you think they're totally different don't you?
2021-09-19 01:38:50	riv	i agree with what you said earlier, that they have a similarity
2021-09-19 01:38:58	riv	they both involve a diagonalization construction
2021-09-19 01:39:54	brownorange	sets are not wffs.. so the solution may not be exactly the same
2021-09-19 01:42:16	[itchyjunk]	Is incompleteness something that you "solve" ?
2021-09-19 01:42:25	[itchyjunk]	I thought it came with the formal system you choose
2021-09-19 01:42:47	[itchyjunk]	you can go to a complete system but you can prove false things to be true or somesuch?
2021-09-19 01:43:37	brownorange	itchyjunk, the working idea is math is inconsistent because undecidable statements violate L.E.M.
2021-09-19 01:43:42	tusko	mh_le obviously pi is based on it
2021-09-19 01:43:54	brownorange	im' saying the paradox leads to contradiction just as in the russell\ paradox
2021-09-19 01:44:15	brownorange	and now i'm trying to solve it similarly like the russel paradox got solved
2021-09-19 01:44:51	[itchyjunk]	eh, beyond me to understand this
2021-09-19 01:45:18	tusko	Suppose we had a string, and that string had been operated on by Vigenere (but we learned how long the key was!). So, we scan it and put each i-th character into one of keyLength many bins. each of those bins should display some variance amongst themselves.
2021-09-19 01:45:48	tusko	I'm wondering what the exact relationship is between the characters in a bin all having been shifted by the same amount and their variance while encoded.
2021-09-19 01:45:51	mh_le	tusko: pi is based on what?
2021-09-19 01:46:10	tusko	1pi = tau/2
2021-09-19 01:46:13	qergle	please refresh me, is the variance analysis kasikis?

2021-09-19 01:47:48	tusko	qergle, that's right. I have some ciphertext. When I put each character into i bins 1 <= i <= x (assuming the key length is between 1 and x), population variance is maximized when we select the proper key length.
2021-09-19 01:48:20	tusko	Sorry, the average of the population variances of each bin is maximized.

2021-09-19 21:32:24	cherim	Like with Alekhine
2021-09-19 21:32:47	qergle	we already have some surjection N → C, and likewise from N → S_i for all i.
2021-09-19 21:33:18	W	qergle, yeah no I get the idea that e.g. Z^2 is countable, I just had myself confused thinking I could represent the reals as a union of countable sets (when that really is exactly Z^2 given some order of sets and some order in each set)
2021-09-19 21:33:42	cherim	All my life it was 100% Al'yokhin, now everybody migrated to Alekhin. With Chebyshev it's still Ch'ebyshev more often I guess, but formally ё must be always stressed
2021-09-19 21:34:02	qergle	so f(i)=S_i) and g_i:N→S_i, let h(m,n)=g_m(n)
2021-09-19 21:34:46	qergle	if h is a surjection (which it is), you've proven it

2021-09-19 21:36:10	cuppajoeman	Hey, I'm learning about probability and I found this definition: https://i.imgur.com/Dv68y6c.png this seems super similar to the definition of a topology, are the they same?
2021-09-19 21:37:33	cherim	Z-module: here are even two Kvant articles from different years; I knew http://kvant.mccme.ru/1971/05/o_postulate_bertrana.htm but there was a later http://kvant.mccme.ru/pdf/1998/04/kv0498korobov.pdf
2021-09-19 21:37:46	cherim	Hopefully the structure is obvious already from the formulas
2021-09-19 21:37:59	qergle	topology doesn't go beyond finite intersections.
2021-09-19 21:38:10	cherim	Can't say it's much worse than modern
2021-09-19 21:38:11	Z-module	cuppajoeman: no: in a topology, the collection of open sets (the topology) needs to be closed under only *finite* intersections, and *all* (not just countable) unions, and hardly ever closed under complements.
2021-09-19 21:38:16	rubiksdream	cuppajoeman, not exactly, one big difference is topologies aren't closed under complements

2021-09-20 00:10:22	cuppajoeman	I'm trying to understand the birthday problem: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Calculating_the_probability So far I understand that there are birthdays b1, ..., bn and we want to compute the probability that "forall i < j in {1, ..., n}, b_i != b_j" that's also equivalent to showing "forany i in {2, ..., n}, bi not in {b_1, ...,
2021-09-20 00:10:22	cuppajoeman	b_{i-1} }", but I'm confused on how they get the huge product at the end?
2021-09-20 00:10:53	CuriousErnestBro	johnkeats7 yes ...
2021-09-20 00:10:54	cuppajoeman	(instead of computing the probability that two people have the same birthday we are trying to compute the probaility that no one has the same brithday
2021-09-20 00:11:02	CuriousErnestBro	I don't know the meaning of that
2021-09-20 00:11:28	CuriousErnestBro	It seems to me the optional stopping theorem says E(X_tau|F_0) = k (where k is the starting amount of money)
2021-09-20 00:11:35	qergle	cuppajoeman: correct. and what's the prob of all different birthdays?
2021-09-20 00:11:53	CuriousErnestBro	then E(X_tau) = E(E(X_tau|F_0))=E(k)=k
2021-09-20 00:12:01	cuppajoeman	that's what I'm trying to figure out, based on the wiki article, they use the second characterization of all being different
2021-09-20 00:12:23	johnkeats7	CuriousErnestBro, the thing is if p != q then X_n is not a martingale, so you have to be careful
2021-09-20 00:12:44	qergle	well, in n people, you have C(365,n) ways to pick all different birthdays
2021-09-20 00:12:51	orthoplex64	johnkeats7: yes, but the dual points are another simplex, since simplexes are self-dual
2021-09-20 00:12:51	qergle	and the denominator is 365^n
2021-09-20 00:12:52	biberao	Z-module: sorry?
2021-09-20 00:12:57	biberao	what does that mean?
2021-09-20 00:12:57	johnkeats7	the way i see it the (q/p)^X_n stuff is a neat trick to get a martingale out of the whole ordeal
2021-09-20 00:13:11	cuppajoeman	Right, that explanation totally makes sense
2021-09-20 00:13:18	cuppajoeman	I'm trying to understand what they're doing now

2021-09-20 00:13:27	qergle	where?
2021-09-20 00:13:44	qergle	which equation?
2021-09-20 00:13:46	cuppajoeman	I think they're setting "Event i: birthday i differs from brithday 1 ... i-1"
2021-09-20 00:13:59	CuriousErnestBro	johnkeats7 I can just replace X_n in my expectation with (q/p)^X_n and it just works? E(X_n)= E((q/p)^X_n)=k
2021-09-20 00:14:01	cuppajoeman	They say " Finally, the principle of conditional probability implies that P(A′) is equal to the product of these individual probabilities: "

2021-09-20 18:23:44	akronymus	Got it
2021-09-20 18:24:05	akronymus	Altough, isn't ijk = -1?
2021-09-20 18:24:12	mawk	i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1 [itchyjunk]
2021-09-20 18:24:18	akronymus	i² = j² = k² = ijk = -1
2021-09-20 18:24:20	mawk	but that doesn't say it all, you also need the multiplication table
2021-09-20 18:24:27	int-e	jk = -i, ijk = -i^2 = 1
2021-09-20 18:24:36	mawk	ij = k, ji = -k, jk = i, kj = -i, ki = j, ik = -j

2021-09-20 18:24:47	mawk	ah yeah you don't need it I guess
2021-09-20 18:24:56	akronymus	Was just thinking whether it is something intrinsic or decided arbitraily
2021-09-20 18:24:57	int-e	akronymus: so your jk = -i is inconsistent with ijk = -1
2021-09-20 18:25:26	[itchyjunk]	mawk, ah right i forgot the detalils. but i rememberd you make a choice as to what you want them to be and what not
2021-09-20 18:25:34	mawk	the trick is that when the letters are in order, it's +, otherwise it's -, akronymus

2021-09-20 20:09:14	lok91	But basically, the black box... it makes sense that alpha = alpha/2 + alpha/2, but why is it useful to split it like that? To me, alpha seems simpler.

2021-09-20 20:10:36	riv	if there is a zero factor the product is zero
2021-09-20 20:10:56	riv	or maybe undefined
2021-09-20 20:11:16	rubiksdream	hmm, I agree with you on the former thing you said
2021-09-20 20:12:02	rubiksdream	it should always be defined if there is a zero factor, but I guess the reason we exclude zero factors, and go as far as to say that the product itself should not converge to zero, is that when we want an infinite product to represent a holomorphic function, we want to be able to read off its zeros from the zeros of the individual factors
2021-09-20 20:12:14	rubiksdream	but we cannot do that if for some values, the product has non-vanishing factors, but vanishes

2021-09-20 21:31:54	somiaj	Yes, many functions will need both domain and codomian restrictions to make them bijective to have an inverse. even x^(even power) is an example of this

It's easy to see that the parity of "KJ -> JK" is congruent to pq (mod 2), which is all that matters (since you apply a (p+q)-cycle, p times; and p(p+q-1)===pq (mod 2)). But I'm curious: is there an obvious combination of pq transpositions that bodily transposes K and J?

2021-09-20 23:59:43	isekaijin	For those who happen to TA calculus 4. In the course, students are taught that (a) conservative vector fields are irrotational, and (b) on simply connected domains, irrotational vector fields are conservative. However, computing curls is an annoying chore, and then explicitly choosing a curve to integrate over it to find a potential is an even more annoying chore.
2021-09-21 00:00:02	Z-module	but look, \mu is definitely an n x 1 thing (being mu_X in the top m entries, then mu_Y for the rest), so A\mu  in there does make sense.

2021-09-21 20:12:51	bildramer	say you have a circle in a degree n polynomial parameter space, and want to see how following it permutes the roots
2021-09-21 20:13:24	bildramer	what's the easy cheaty hacky shortcut way? e.g. do it numerically accumulating a matrix or something, and check its properties at the end
2021-09-21 20:14:40	→	Inline has joined ##math
2021-09-21 20:14:54	bildramer	or perhaps it's easier to determine lines that the circle "contains" (line's intersection with the circle's plane is inside circle) that do specific permutations
2021-09-21 20:15:45	cherim	Your terminology is very unusual, I can't even figure out what you want
2021-09-21 20:15:54	cherim	What is a circle here?
2021-09-21 20:17:06	cherim	"circle in a degree n polynomial parameter space" sounds more like you have a family of polynomials with coefficients depending on one parameter
2021-09-21 20:17:07	bildramer	like say ax^2+bx+c=0, then take a,b,c as 3D space, and specify a circle in that space
2021-09-21 20:17:33	bildramer	will probably take 2*n or 2*n-1 numbers but be redundant somehow
2021-09-21 20:17:54	cherim	And a=a(t), b=b(t), c=c(t) where t is the natural parameter on the curve (circle) in your quadratic example?

2021-09-21 20:20:06	bildramer	yeah
2021-09-21 20:20:34	cherim	One thing that is obvious here is that Galois theory is completely irrelevant
2021-09-21 20:21:11	bildramer	now I'm thinking about how the roots don't really have labels, so how do you specify permutations on them? but when one pair of permutations does 1<->2 and 3<->4 and another does 1<->2 and 2<->3 they'll interact differently
2021-09-21 20:22:05	cherim	The concept of "one root transforming into other" here is about continuous trajectories when t varies
2021-09-21 20:22:09	bildramer	well, a bunch of pop math blog posts make it out to be about this kind of thing. I'm wrong then
2021-09-21 20:22:43	cherim	If you fix some t and mark the roots on the complex plane, typically you will have several isolated points
2021-09-21 20:23:07	cherim	So you can draw a circle around each so that it's the only root inside that circle
2021-09-21 20:23:31	cherim	If you now vary the parameter t slightly, the roots will also move only slightly
2021-09-21 20:23:49	cherim	So there will still be only one root in each of previously drawn circles
2021-09-21 20:23:51	bildramer	yes. this is why I ask about a closed curve, a circle: if you follow the roots' paths (after labeling them), 0->1 and 1->0 is distinguishable from 0->0 and 1->1

2021-09-21 20:57:42	pyzozord	I think I've eliminated the possibility that what I have trouble with is programming
2021-09-21 20:58:01	pyzozord	I probably have troubles with math part because I don't know any math
2021-09-21 20:58:21	←	gioyik has quit (Ping timeout: 276 seconds)
2021-09-21 20:58:37	pyzozord	But I don't think that is the culprit. I think the real reason is the elusive "problem solving" ability, or maybe puzzle solving
2021-09-21 20:58:47	pyzozord	I think you guys might be the best place to ask for help
2021-09-21 20:59:07	pyzozord	How can I learn the right way to think about / approach and solve problems
2021-09-21 21:00:00	pyzozord	I feel my mind often explodes at the amount of possiblities and just refuses to think further, or I just seem not able to pivot my mindset/point of view in a way to make the problem more approachable
2021-09-21 21:00:12	pyzozord	can you give me any advice?
2021-09-21 21:01:47	cherim	Read texts (like https://cses.fi/book/book.pdf), solve non-random/thematic problemsets (like https://cses.fi/problemset/ for that text in particular)
2021-09-21 21:03:16	pyzozord	That problem with flags is simple: count the peaks by looking at neighbors. Then list distances between peaks. Then prepare frequency map of the distances. Then... And here I have problem. There is some kind of relationship between distances and frequences of distances and I can't figure out what is it exaclty. I always end up missing some edge caseses. And when I fix this edge case previous edge case
2021-09-21 21:03:22	pyzozord	comes up
2021-09-21 21:04:13	pyzozord	cherim: thanks. I have few books like this. I don't really think my problem is with datastructures or algorithms. It's something more basic then that
2021-09-21 21:05:00	cherim	You say the problem is not with programming
2021-09-21 21:05:19	cherim	But then you describe a problem that is essentially with programming
2021-09-21 21:05:44	pyzozord	The same problem can be phrased without any programming at all
2021-09-21 21:05:56	pyzozord	it's more conceptualization of the solution that I have problem with
2021-09-21 21:06:00	cherim	I.e. having difficulty with correctly keeping the environment when formalizing an algorithm
2021-09-21 21:06:34	cherim	People avoid troubles with edge cases using good programming idioms
2021-09-21 21:07:25	pyzozord	Here is another example: I couldn't figure out how to factorize common primes
2021-09-21 21:08:03	Z-module	You give me any prime in Z, no matter how huge, and I'll instantly give you all of its possible factorizations in Z.
2021-09-21 21:08:10	pyzozord	I spent an hour and a half with pen and paper, and couldn't get it
2021-09-21 21:08:35	cherim	Actually, let's go back to the peaks
2021-09-21 21:08:47	cherim	What do you do exactly?

2021-09-21 21:12:13	pyzozord	distfreqpref stands for "distanec frequencies prefix" because I'm using a prefix sum https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prefix_sum to know how many flags in total I could get at given distance
2021-09-21 21:14:36	cherim	To me the brute() part looks meaningful but everything before it just goes nowhere
2021-09-21 21:15:04	cherim	How are you going to extract the answer from the frequency arrays you build? What's the final scheme?
2021-09-21 21:15:27	pyzozord	that's the thing I don't know
2021-09-21 21:15:41	pyzozord	lines 24-30 are experimental
2021-09-21 21:15:52	cherim	Anyway, we can get to the point pretty fast here, avoiding finding bugs in brute() and the rest
2021-09-21 21:16:01	cherim	This is a binary search problem
2021-09-21 21:16:29	pyzozord	it's actually in the "prime and composite numbers" section
2021-09-21 21:16:31	pyzozord	https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons/10-prime_and_composite_numbers/
2021-09-21 21:16:48	cherim	Your trouble is that you don't recognize the algorithmic class (binary search over the final answer, using brute force check for each candidate answer)
2021-09-21 21:17:25	pyzozord	binary search is a lesson 14 and this is lesson 10 so I think there is some other answer

2021-09-21 21:18:43	cherim	Well, this peaks thing is certainly not about prime and composite numbers...

2021-09-21 21:19:29	cherim	This is not really #math, however, more like #algorithms

2021-09-21 21:26:19	pyzozord	I've missed a lot of education, I dropped at at the age of 16 from school. But before that I wasn't really studing hard either
2021-09-21 21:26:40	cherim	But the returns are rapidly diminishing with that general ability, a top GM will never go "the opponent is only a 2400 GM, I'll just do random moves and then outcalculate him somewhere"

2021-09-21 21:27:29	cherim	It's the particular skills (pattern matching) that matter after that point

2021-09-21 21:52:11	isekaijin	But if you take the limit first, you get 0 = 0, and then any value of x is a solution.
2021-09-21 21:52:37	drobi	those aren't continuous right?
2021-09-21 21:52:47	isekaijin	Sure as hell 1/y and 2/y are continuous functions.

2021-09-21 21:53:27	isekaijin	That is outside the domain.

2021-09-21 21:53:44	isekaijin	But, in any case, you can tweak the functions 1/y and 2/y away from infinity.
2021-09-21 21:54:09	drobi	well I guess my h,g,f, are continous for any value of y
2021-09-21 21:54:31	isekaijin	As I said, you can easily tweak the definitions of f, g, h away from infinity.
2021-09-21 21:54:50	isekaijin	So that f, g, h are continuous and defined for every value of y, including 0.

2021-09-21 21:56:18	isekaijin	For example, if x and y are real-valued, then you could set f(y) = 1/y for |y| >= 1, and then connect the values of f(-1) and f(1) with a straight line.

2021-09-21 21:57:40	drobi	I appreciate the example though
2021-09-21 21:58:15	cherim	Anything with all 3 functions having limit=0 will typically be a counterexample
2021-09-21 21:58:36	isekaijin	Maybe your functions f, g, h satisfy a much stronger condition? Perhaps they are analytic or even given by polynomials.
2021-09-21 21:58:55	drobi	yes, they are given by polynomials
2021-09-21 21:59:14	isekaijin	Okay, then we need to pass to the so-called “projective space” to study the behavior “at infinity”.

2021-09-22 20:27:52	piou	I guess regrouping is equivalent to reordering then

2021-09-22 20:28:26	piou	Actually now that I think about it it's obvious that it is equivalent to reordering, thanks
2021-09-22 20:28:38	cherim	If (a+b)+(c+d)+(e+f)... and a+(b+c)+(d+e)+(f+...) have two different sums, then the general term of a+b+c+d+... does not tend to 0 and the a+b+c+... series is not convergent
2021-09-22 20:28:47	cherim	But what you do is not reordering at all
2021-09-22 20:29:04	cherim	You skip some partial sums which is impossible with any reordering
2021-09-22 20:29:14	isekaijin	Mmm... cherim is right, I messed up.
2021-09-22 20:29:38	cherim	For example, there is no reordering of 1+1-1+1-1+... that results in a convergent series, but your (1-1)+(1-1)+... provide one
2021-09-22 20:30:11	piou	I see
2021-09-22 20:30:57	piou	Well, I see that it's not equivalent to reordering at least, but I don't get your last part « then the general term of a+b+c+d+... does not tend to 0 and the a+b+c+... series is not convergent »
2021-09-22 20:32:02	cherim	[(a+b)+(c+d)+(e+f)] - [a+ (b+c)+(d+e)] = f

2021-09-22 23:03:50	bosspotato	you show that that sum satisfies exp(ab) = exp(a) exp(b) and you define e to be exp(1)

2021-09-22 23:05:35	bosspotato	yes
2021-09-22 23:05:39	riv	alternatively, a^b is defined as exp(b * log(a))

2021-09-22 23:10:03	cuppajoeman	Ok, I'm still intruiged by the taylor series stuff, to show that a function is equal to the taylor series you have to define an error function and show that the limit of the error function as n goes to inf is zero right?
2021-09-22 23:10:08	cuppajoeman	Is that the general principle?
2021-09-22 23:10:37	bosspotato	you use taylor-lagrange normally

2021-09-22 23:28:03	cuppajoeman	I'm so confused by what is even happening in this question (Complex Numbers, transformations): https://i.imgur.com/FUXHg8C.png
2021-09-22 23:28:03	HisShadow	you can define those with series too
2021-09-22 23:28:14	riv	okay
2021-09-22 23:28:27	riv	sin(x) can be defined as either
2021-09-22 23:28:29	cuppajoeman	HisShadow: So when do we actually have to prove that a function is equal to it's taylor series
2021-09-22 23:28:42	cuppajoeman	if everything is by definition
2021-09-22 23:29:20	HisShadow	when you expand a function into a series that's defined as something else
2021-09-22 23:29:34	cuppajoeman	Ok
2021-09-22 23:29:35	riv	sin(x) = sum[n=0,inf] (-1)^n x^(2n+1)/(2n+1)!
2021-09-22 23:30:13	cuppajoeman	for me sin(x) = o/h in a right triangle with hyp h, and opposite side o
2021-09-22 23:30:16	riv	or sin(x) = exp(i x) - exp(- i x) / 2i
2021-09-22 23:30:40	riv	or sin(x) = (exp(i x) - exp(- i x)) / 2i
2021-09-22 23:30:44	riv	needed the brackets
2021-09-22 23:30:56	riv	ok so we have 3 definitions of sin
2021-09-22 23:31:14	riv	you can show the two i gave equivalent very easily
2021-09-22 23:31:28	cuppajoeman	using the  def of exp
2021-09-22 23:31:32	riv	yes
2021-09-22 23:32:06	cuppajoeman	seems hard to prove it equal to the geometric one
2021-09-22 23:32:13	riv	yes
2021-09-22 23:32:14	cuppajoeman	or less obvious at least
2021-09-22 23:32:56	riv	but if you know that d/dx sin(x) = cos(x) and d/dx cos(x) = -sin(x)
2021-09-22 23:33:04	riv	you can produce the taylor series
2021-09-22 23:33:28	cuppajoeman	doesn't the proof of those usually use the taylor series of sin and cos
2021-09-22 23:33:50	cuppajoeman	Or are you saying it's proven by a geometric argument
2021-09-22 23:33:51	riv	you don't have a proof of d/dx sin(x) = cos(x) using the geometric definitions?
2021-09-22 23:34:03	cuppajoeman	yeah I do, but idk if it's rigourus
2021-09-22 23:34:29	cuppajoeman	it's like you assume the change in angle produces a new triangle and you can show the change in height is cos(x)
2021-09-22 23:34:39	cuppajoeman	it's a super small trinalg
2021-09-22 23:34:40	riv	yes

2021-09-22 23:34:46	cuppajoeman	Is that an actual proof?

2021-09-23 16:04:56	Hory	for example in set theory there can be different relations with the same domains / codomains
2021-09-23 16:08:56	Hory	so I'm asking if in the concept of a product type there is latitude for some undefined difference or if they are strictly defined

2021-09-23 19:43:08	dude12312414	the cos term has frequency |f1 - f2|/2, but the maxima actually happen twice as fast because the high frequency oscillations will quickly go between +1 and -1, so the sign of the envelope term becomes irrelevant

2021-09-23 23:26:27	Z-module	well, if you have some sequence I_1, I_2, ... of open intervals where each  I_(n+1) is a subset of I_n, it *can* happen that the intersection  cap_n I_n   is nonempty.  But this never happens if eventually all the I_n have the same left endpoint x while the right endpoints -> x,  or if eventually all the I_n have the same right endpoint x while the left endpoints -> x.

Maybe ~Prov(a) or Prov(a) is not in fact to do with a propositional L.E.M. Thus unprovable wffs that are embedding such notions are a vindication of the formal system being correct and should not be used to demonstrate incompleteness.

2021-09-24 15:23:58	brownorange	so far as "This sentence is false" is both unprovable and true, it's because it contains an inconsistency, so we shouldn't care about it.

2021-09-24 19:00:41	cherim	Your question is not really about some objective mathematical fact but about a convention like "will people understand what is meant if I write XXX under the summation sign"?
2021-09-24 19:01:34	cherim	sum_{j=1}^{n},   sum_{j \in S},  sum_{j^2= s (mod p)},    sum_{j: (i, j) \in B} are all OK
2021-09-24 19:02:12	sgara	there must be a definition of summatory
2021-09-24 19:02:17	cherim	No

2021-09-24 23:14:01	tusko	How do you do matrix multiplication modulo some number?
2021-09-24 23:14:26	int-e	Guest19: looks better, but shouldn't you have three cases though
2021-09-24 23:14:29	Z-module	you can do the reductions at any point, makes no difference
2021-09-24 23:14:56	Z-module	Z -> Z/mZ  is a ring homomorphism, and matrix multiplication uses nothing but finite combos of + and *
2021-09-24 23:15:06	Guest19	Do you mean I should just say we have either inequality or equality?

2021-09-24 23:42:52	int-e	Guest19: The same goes for compatibility (where you've done that, maybe because it doesn't require multiple cases). I'm not so sure about well-foundedness because that is a tricky property.

2021-09-25 21:15:41	somiaj	pyzozord: a vector has operations assoicated with it, a tuple is just an ordered list of numbers
2021-09-25 21:15:45	→	texasmusicinstru has joined ##math
2021-09-25 21:15:50	←	texasmusicinstru has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
2021-09-25 21:16:59	somiaj	but since vector spaces have basis, if you have a vector space with dimension n, whose bases is {v1, v2, v3, ..., vn}, then every vector can be written in the form a1 v1 + a2 v2 + a3 v3 + .... + an vn, so it is convient to just write the vector as (a1, a2, a3, ..., an), when the basis is known
2021-09-25 21:17:16	somiaj	hence a tuple can be used to represent a vector, but can also be used for other things in which vector operations are not present.
2021-09-25 21:17:45	→	texasmusicinstru has joined ##math
2021-09-25 21:17:55	somiaj	though this isn't really different than our base 10 numbers, 142.85 is really 100 + 4*10 + 2 + 8/10 + 5/100, but we choose to write it as 142.85 (basically a list of numbers) for convience

2021-09-25 21:21:15	cherim	I still see no relevance for "factrization into primes" topic there, however. There is also an intermediate O(nlogn) solutiion where one can cite the prime sieve complexity, but it's far-fetched
2021-09-25 21:21:49	cherim	The cleanest O(n) uses nextFlag[i] and looping only up to sqrt(n) for K.
2021-09-25 21:21:56	cherim	What's yours?
2021-09-25 21:22:10	pyzozord	here is my solution https://app.codility.com/demo/results/trainingSVGW5Q-WTU/
2021-09-25 21:22:37	pyzozord	it's O(n log n) if n is peaks, but that's O(n) if n is entire trip
2021-09-25 21:23:48	pyzozord	took me a lot of effort to realize that I cannot simply use distances between neighbour peaks because the peaks I picked don't need to be necessairly neighbours
2021-09-25 21:24:03	pyzozord	after I realized that fact it took me 30 minutes to write correct solution

2021-09-25 21:26:10	pyzozord	the relationship with primes was just the structure of n log n algorithm. Just the idea you can "skip" when looping esentially
2021-09-25 21:26:23	ppw	is it ever proper to put proofs at the end of some assignment that deals extensively with math, but you don't want to disrupt the flow of the assignment?

2021-09-25 21:27:34	cherim	Note that you can never put more than sqrt(n) flags anyway, there is simply not enough space
2021-09-25 21:27:37	pyzozord	well I didn't really understand what you said, I don't really understand it now either
2021-09-25 21:28:28	cherim	And you can test whether you can put k flags in O(k), just applying curr=peaks[curr+k] k times
2021-09-25 21:28:59	cherim	So you only have to do O(1+2+3+...+sqrt(n))=O(n) work total
2021-09-25 21:29:30	pyzozord	i don't really follow that, I just simulate where to put flags but skip to the next first legal peak or break

2021-09-25 21:30:58	cherim	OK, I can either explain more or drop the topic at the point "there is O(n) and not O(nlogn)"
2021-09-25 21:31:01	pyzozord	but yeah it is 1+2+3...sqrt(n) that's what I concluded as well
2021-09-25 21:31:37	pyzozord	I think my algo is O(n)

2021-09-25 21:34:02	pyzozord	even if you are doing O(log n) binary search on the peaks, you still first need O(n) to get all peaks

2021-09-25 21:35:26	pyzozord	remember: absolutely no mathematical education
2021-09-25 21:35:42	cherim	When i < sqrt(n), your j loop takes ~i time
2021-09-25 21:35:52	cherim	When i > sqrt(n), your j loop takes ~n/i time
2021-09-25 21:36:23	cherim	In the first case because you exit after i flags set, in the second because you jump by i and do n/i jumps
2021-09-25 21:36:31	cherim	Agree?
2021-09-25 21:37:02	pyzozord	i think in the first case i still skip. I don't see the relationship to sqrt(n)
2021-09-25 21:37:33	pyzozord	so I think it's ~n/i jumps always
2021-09-25 21:38:05	cherim	There is also break in line 31?
2021-09-25 21:38:24	cherim	You immediately exit when i flags set, even if i< n/i?
2021-09-25 21:38:59	pyzozord	no, notice that in line 15 the loop continues until j<A.length
2021-09-25 21:39:21	pyzozord	break in line 31 is meant as "if you have no more flags to set, stop walking"
2021-09-25 21:39:24	→	drobi has joined ##math

2021-09-25 21:40:15	pyzozord	so it's "walk from start to finishing: instead of walking jump on peaks, plant a flag, if you are out of flags stop walking"
2021-09-25 21:41:43	cherim	In the sitation where almost everything is a peak, every jump results in flag++
2021-09-25 21:41:48	cherim	That's the worst case
2021-09-25 21:41:52	pyzozord	that's all wrapped in the bigger loop "ok we will try walking entire trip with different amounts of flags, start with one flag, end with end with as many flags as meters"
2021-09-25 21:42:11	cherim	After each flag++, you test if (flags == i) break
2021-09-25 21:42:31	cherim	There is no way you do more than "flags set" steps if every step results in a new flag
2021-09-25 21:42:49	cherim	Unless I am misunderstanding flow in JS

2021-09-25 21:43:23	pyzozord	everything cannot be a peak, you'll get at max N/2 peaks

2021-09-25 21:43:57	cherim	Any distance O(1) between peaks is essentially the same
2021-09-25 21:44:33	pyzozord	it will try N times to make only one step
2021-09-25 21:44:49	cherim	But the whole point of what I am explaining here is that your code is O(nlogn), if you agree (but for another reason), it's OK
2021-09-25 21:45:39	pyzozord	I thought it was O(n log n) too
2021-09-25 21:45:47	cherim	What I say is that you can make the outer i loop not till n, but till sqrt(n)+1 or such, keeping validity
2021-09-25 21:45:58	cherim	And that will make the code O(n)
2021-09-25 21:45:59	pyzozord	but it was explained to me that it is O(n log n) where n=peaks but it is O(n) when n=trip

2021-09-25 21:46:14	pyzozord	oh right

2021-09-25 21:46:32	pyzozord	i'm not 100% sure though
2021-09-25 21:46:46	cherim	But if you follow the argument as you gave it, you'll still get O(nlogn)
2021-09-25 21:46:56	cherim	Which becomes wrong in this case
2021-09-25 21:46:57	pyzozord	would need to think hard to figure out if it won't break for some weird edge cases
2021-09-25 21:46:59	ppw	why is this conversation in ##math?? is there no #algorithms channel?
2021-09-25 21:47:01	cherim	It's in fact O(n)

2021-09-25 21:49:06	pyzozord	last time i visited here asking about how to aquire general mathematicial thinking ability was asked for specifics and that flags problem was what I was struggling at the moment

2021-09-26 00:20:02	vckt	inf(A) <= a forall a in A, inf(B) <= b forall b in B, so we can say inf(A) + inf(B) <= a + b forall a in A, forall b in B
2021-09-26 00:20:24	vckt	i'm confused as to whether i can conclude in the next step by saying that by the definition of C, we can say:

2021-09-26 00:22:40	nagefire	riv that's a fair point

2021-09-26 00:26:58	riv	no
2021-09-26 00:27:12	riv	it exists because A is bounded below

2021-09-26 19:10:12	kobalt	I have seen some proofs that said to add the neighbour of v1 and vk to P if they are not already in P and then the new path will be longest path. But I missed the fact that when we do this we must then relabel the terminal vertex as v1 or vk
2021-09-26 19:10:51	int-e	kobalt: In principle you could write a different proof that just starts with any path and keeps extending it until it becomes Hamiltonian. But... such a proof would have to deal with many different paths, whereas starting out with picking a longest path allows the whole proof to focus on that single path and a couple of hypothetical ones that would be longer (hence can't exist).

Is the

2021-09-26 23:57:17	cuppajoeman	Oh maybe they're using the fact that if f(x) < g(x) then the lims are less than or equal as you said?

2021-09-26 23:58:15	ChoHag	I simply turned the problem of "what is the term for this operation" into the simpler problem of "google it".
2021-09-26 23:58:42	cuppajoeman	Do we know if for any function f, that lim x -> a |f(x)| >= 0 ?

2021-09-26 23:59:46	Z-module	because |...| is always >= 0
2021-09-27 00:00:04	cuppajoeman	Well I get that | lim x -> a f(x)| > 0
2021-09-27 00:00:11	cuppajoeman	and intuitively the other one too
2021-09-27 00:00:31	cuppajoeman	Is it the case that |lim x -> a f(x)| = lim x -> a |f(x)| ?
2021-09-27 00:00:49	cuppajoeman	should be right, it's just mirrored?
2021-09-27 00:00:50	Z-module	yes, the absolute value function is continuous everywhere
2021-09-27 00:01:11	cuppajoeman	And you're using that fact how?
2021-09-27 00:01:24	→	texasmusicinstru has joined ##math
2021-09-27 00:02:09	cuppajoeman	so you're writing, for any continuous function h, then we know that h(lim x-> a f(x)) = lim x -> a h(f(x))

2021-09-27 00:13:59	jrm	Is this correct?  From a set of n elements, to calculate the number of all subsets, it's choose(n,0) + choose(n,1) + choose(n,2) + ... + choose(n,n).
2021-09-27 00:14:21	Z-module	yes, which has a nice shortcut form

2021-09-27 00:14:39	somiaj	cuppajoeman: that is not what you wrote, and that would only be equal to h(f(a)) if f was continous, which wasn't in your statement (that I saw)
2021-09-27 00:14:55	cuppajoeman	jrm, you can proof the number of subsets using induction
2021-09-27 00:15:03	←	vckt has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2021-09-27 00:15:04	somiaj	though I guess in this case you only need h(f(x)) to be continous and not f(x) itself.
2021-09-27 00:15:16	cherim	The main restriction in that formula comes from the fact that lim x-> a f(x)  in LHS must exist (otherwise there is no claim)
2021-09-27 00:15:43	cherim	It already makes f almost continuous (up to a redifinition of f(a))
2021-09-27 00:16:01	cuppajoeman	jrm: Or you can use the binmial theorem (x + y) ^n with x = y = 1
2021-09-27 00:16:07	jrm	It's just a general curiosity.  The OS packing system that I work on has options.  I'm curious about the total number of ways to test the package, e.g., with all options off, option 1 and 3 on, all options on, etc.

2021-09-27 00:16:59	somiaj	jrm: If you just think of say having n-options, you have a bitstring of length n, which is just n 0's or 1's.
2021-09-27 00:17:20	cuppajoeman	Is there a name for this composition rule?
2021-09-27 00:17:24	somiaj	jrm: the number of cases for each position (or option) is 2, and so there are 2*2*2*...*2 = 2^n possible ways to choose which options are on/off

2021-09-27 00:27:15	cherim	Where do compositions of continuous functions are appearing here?
2021-09-27 00:27:20	cuppajoeman	we end up with |f_i(x) - L_i | < = || f(x)  - L  ||

2021-09-28 16:04:47	joel135	i am inclined to agree that it is hard to know what existence would mean beyond constructability, but at least it probably has to be weaker, strictly or not

2021-09-28 16:05:30	PlanckWalk	Without choice, you can't prove it exists

2021-09-28 16:07:04	mornfall	the one riv gave earlier
2021-09-28 16:07:24	mornfall	or perhaps PlanckWalk's formulation, which i am not even sure is equivalent
2021-09-28 16:08:41	PlanckWalk	You can prove that every path has a finite extension
2021-09-28 16:09:04	PlanckWalk	But without some form of choice, you can't (in general) prove that it has a *infinite* extension.
2021-09-28 16:09:39	mornfall	you need to prove it doesn't, which is different from being unable to prove it does
2021-09-28 16:09:51	PlanckWalk	With a negation of choice, you can prove it doesn't.
2021-09-28 16:10:26	PlanckWalk	Which is why the first thing I said was "Is this assuming the negation of Choice or something?"
2021-09-28 16:11:16	PlanckWalk	But that question was never answered.
2021-09-28 16:11:52	mornfall	right, so back to the part where you prove an object exists (the finitely extended path) and also that it cannot be constructed (if you can construct the finite extension, surely you can use induction to construct an infinite path)
2021-09-28 16:11:57	→	chenxuezhao has joined ##math
2021-09-28 16:12:11	PlanckWalk	You can't use induction to construct an infinite path.
2021-09-28 16:12:22	PlanckWalk	You can only use it to construct finite paths of every length.
2021-09-28 16:13:45	PlanckWalk	Then *if* you had Dependent Choice, you could select one extension from every one of the infinitely many sets and get an infinite path.
2021-09-28 16:14:54	PlanckWalk	If you have some negation of Dependent Choice (which may literally just be *the* negation of DC), then you can prove that there exists some graph where you can't do that.
2021-09-28 16:14:55	mornfall	so why can't i take the union of the infinite number of extensions? they are all finite after all
2021-09-28 16:15:13	PlanckWalk	There are infinitely many extensions

2021-09-28 16:15:43	mornfall	sure, but i am constructing just one path
2021-09-28 16:15:46	PlanckWalk	As in, infinitely many *choices* of extensions
2021-09-28 16:16:04	PlanckWalk	If you take the union of all of them, you don't get a path
2021-09-28 16:16:09	PlanckWalk	You just get a subtree
2021-09-28 16:16:14	mornfall	yes i do, they are all extensions of each other
2021-09-28 16:16:21	mornfall	that's what a path is
2021-09-28 16:16:33	joel135	extension is 'nondeterministic' at each step
2021-09-28 16:16:37	PlanckWalk	You can only specify *finitely* many extensions.
2021-09-28 16:16:54	mornfall	if you can construct _the_ finite extension
2021-09-28 16:16:57	PlanckWalk	You can prove that for every finite length there are extensions
2021-09-28 16:17:02	mornfall	just one specific extension; doesn't matter which
2021-09-28 16:17:26	PlanckWalk	No matter how long a finite length you specify, there are still infinitely many choices to be made for the ret.
2021-09-28 16:17:29	PlanckWalk	rest*
2021-09-28 16:18:17	mornfall	you make it; then you make another of the longer path, which is a superset; by induction, you have a chain of paths, each a superset of the previous?
2021-09-28 16:18:34	mornfall	or perhaps induction doesn't work in this theory?
2021-09-28 16:18:47	PlanckWalk	It doesn't
2021-09-28 16:18:54	PlanckWalk	Well, it works, but not *like that*
2021-09-28 16:19:03	mornfall	how does it work, then? :)
2021-09-28 16:19:39	joel135	if you interpret 'can be extended one more step' intuitionistically, you do get a specific extension, which can be extended infinitely and constructively
2021-09-28 16:20:03	joel135	from this perspective, the problem lies in " That is, "
2021-09-28 16:20:23	mornfall	joel135: so i have been saying since the start, you must prove that the finite extension exists _and_ that it cannot be constructed
2021-09-28 16:20:36	mornfall	because if it can be constructed, i really don't see how the induction fails
2021-09-28 16:20:37	joel135	i don't get what you mean
2021-09-28 16:20:40	PlanckWalk	mornfall: Just look at the form of induction.  The conclusion is of the form "for all n, there exists..."
2021-09-28 16:21:17	PlanckWalk	It *doesn't* say "there exists <something> such that for all n, ..."
2021-09-28 16:21:30	joel135	(if you could rephrase it as 'you must ... *in order to* ..." it would be clearer)
2021-09-28 16:22:08	mornfall	joel135: in order to prevent the inductive construction of an infinite path
2021-09-28 16:22:09	PlanckWalk	You need a principle stronger than just induction to get from finitely many to infinitely many.
2021-09-28 16:22:49	mornfall	induction and an infinite union (the latter is presumably available)
2021-09-28 16:23:11	PlanckWalk	A well-ordering principle would do, but the proposition that any set can be well-ordered is equivalent to Axiom of Choice (with suitable other set theory axioms)
2021-09-28 16:23:26	PlanckWalk	mornfall: Infinite union is available, but you don't have a suitable set
2021-09-28 16:23:49	joel135	'to prevent the inductive construction of an infinite path' could mean different things. i would default to a model theoretic perspective rather than the assumption of the negative of a principle.

2021-09-28 16:31:17	joel135	of the refutation of the claim of constructive existence, that is
2021-09-28 16:32:03	mornfall	so i am in possession of a finite path, and it needs to be shown that the path cannot be made infinite by following one of the other edges (clearly, there is a ‘free’ edge at the end of every finite path)
2021-09-28 16:33:12	mornfall	so if the original claim is to be true, this has to fail somewhere, but i currently don't see the failure

2021-09-28 16:34:52	joel135	"and it needs to be shown that the path cannot be made infinite by following one of the other edges" this is a little imprecise: you are implying an agreed upon means of construction when you use the word "made"
2021-09-28 16:35:02	mornfall	i can surely construct the set of neighbours, subtract the vertices on the path; this is a non-empty set from which i need to pick one vertex
2021-09-28 16:35:34	mornfall	which i think is okay even with anti-choice
2021-09-28 16:35:41	joel135	picking one vertex in infinite succession is precisely what requires choice, if the assumed existence of this vertex is non-constructive
2021-09-28 16:36:28	joel135	if it is constructive on the other hand then dependent type theory will have no problem giving you the infinite path

2021-09-28 16:38:34	mornfall	which means this is what i need to show: a one-step extension cannot be constructed (though its existence can be proved)
2021-09-28 16:38:42	joel135	yes, but it still works at any finite depth, nonconstructively
2021-09-28 16:39:36	joel135	what i mean is: one can constructively transform a nonconstructive proof for one step into a nonconstructive proof for finitely many steps
2021-09-28 16:40:06	mornfall	yes, i can see that
2021-09-28 16:40:40	joel135	in particular this transformation doesn't use choice
2021-09-28 16:40:45	mornfall	what i still don't see is why the one-step extension of a fixed path cannot be constructed
2021-09-28 16:41:06	joel135	it is because it wasn't assumed to be constructible
2021-09-28 16:41:36	mornfall	was it _assumed_ to be non-constructible? or is there a way to ensure it is, without assuming it?

2021-09-28 18:18:55	quarterback	I am thinking there may be a unique solution and I havent thought of what planes they represent and the obvious condition is that the system of equations is non singular i.e their determinant is not zero.

2021-09-28 18:20:05	quarterback	There may be many ways o correct a equation . i.e change its variables so that it may give a solution with other equations. Does this mean that many such corrections are possible?

2021-09-28 18:28:22	quarterback	 if det G !=0 then the solution is unique. Is that right?

2021-09-28 22:06:34	[-_-]	can someone suggest a good book for learning fourier series and fourier transform?
2021-09-28 22:06:58	pikapika	tusko, what kind of probability stuff are they teaching
2021-09-28 22:07:48	tusko	Basics, counting, probability axioms, conditional probabilities, random variables, jointly distributed, ..., simulations
2021-09-28 22:08:18	pikapika	tusko, I'd say

2021-09-28 23:30:07	peepsalot	i'm using a software library which has a notion of "convexity" of polyhedrons as a natural number, representing the maximum number of times an arbitrary ray can intersect with said polyhedron.
2021-09-28 23:30:11	peepsalot	so a truly convex polyhedron has "convexity" of 1...  a torus would have convexity of 2, etc.

2021-09-29 10:41:00	brownorange	Hello. Consider an algorithm where you treat an array of bytes as a value, and increase by 1 each iteration. suppose that when you hit the overflow point you simply added 1 byte. In time this would not only produce all outputs of programs, it would produce all programs.
2021-09-29 10:41:26	brownorange	but it would see mto me what iv'e described is a program. so how could all programs be produced?
2021-09-29 10:41:41	←	trace987 has quit (Ping timeout: 245 seconds)
2021-09-29 10:42:25	brownorange	also if some programs don't halt, then i'm not sure what it would mean to say all outputs of all programs could be produced
2021-09-29 10:42:35	mornfall	there's no contradiction
2021-09-29 10:43:12	W	a program can produce itself, it even has a name, a quine
2021-09-29 10:43:22	mornfall	you can't enumerate all programs in finite time
2021-09-29 10:43:57	mornfall	you might be looking for the distinction between recursive and recursively enumerable
2021-09-29 10:44:11	brownorange	yes
2021-09-29 10:45:00	mornfall	(though the set of all natural numbers is regular; but it's probably not what you had in mind)
2021-09-29 10:45:35	mornfall	(co-finite even, the almost simplest set in terms of computability that you can come up with)
2021-09-29 10:46:13	brownorange	how could we even prove we had all the halting programs without first testing which are or are not?

2021-09-29 10:46:31	brownorange	yet I can think of no better way then this counting process
2021-09-29 10:47:47	mornfall	what is a halting program?
2021-09-29 10:48:14	brownorange	a program which halts, is a halting program.
2021-09-29 10:48:28	mornfall	on some input? all inputs? a specific input?
2021-09-29 10:48:54	W	it depends on what you mean by "we had"; if a process outputs all possible programs, the process necessarily also produce any subset of possible programs, such as all programs that halt
2021-09-29 10:50:36	brownorange	then it would seem comparing proofs and programs doesn't really work
2021-09-29 10:50:57	mornfall	in asmuch as a digital scan of a botticelli painting is a natural number (which is easily arranged), you also enumerate all possible scans of all botticelli paintings… the problem is telling them from the rest of the natural numbers
2021-09-29 10:51:48	brownorange	when all encodings are produceable then i believe interpretation doesn't matter
2021-09-29 10:52:08	brownorange	that's where i was going with this counting process

2021-09-29 10:57:31	brownorange	my understanding is you could produce limitless wffs because you could produce limitless finite numbers

2021-09-29 10:59:03	brownorange	the space of mathematical statements balloons thanks to numbers
2021-09-29 10:59:53	brownorange	if addition can produce these numbers that also includes the set of all programs (and thus imaginable theorems),  this is insightful to incompleteness I would think
2021-09-29 11:00:21	mornfall	W: hmm? you can generate all the correct proofs in an inference system
2021-09-29 11:01:03	mornfall	brownorange: no it's not; it has to be the exact set, not an arbitrary superset
2021-09-29 11:03:14	mornfall	W: you can do even better, you can decide whether a given input is a correct proof; that's the whole point of proofs
2021-09-29 11:04:27	mornfall	what you usually can't do is decide whether a given statement is _true_ (which is different from provable, in general)
2021-09-29 11:04:57	brownorange	@mornfall but addition would easily produce so many proofs and non-proofs. but it's a matter of interpretation of the numbers
2021-09-29 11:05:12	brownorange	let's say we had a godel encoding for our formulas
2021-09-29 11:05:54	mornfall	brownorange: the interpretation has to be mechanical (otherwise, we are talking castles in the sky)
2021-09-29 11:06:08	mornfall	the mechanical interpretation is a turing machine, or whatever formalism you prefer
2021-09-29 11:07:45	brownorange	this may sound crazy to ask. but godel's own encoding is complete right? that is every encoded formula is provable or not provable as being a wff of math?
2021-09-29 11:07:48	mornfall	a turing machine can tell proofs from non-proofs, but it can't tell truth from non-truth (in a sufficiently strong theory); positing a machine which could do that leads to contradictions

2021-09-29 11:09:18	mornfall	that's not a thing to prove, it's a thing to decide
2021-09-29 11:09:44	mornfall	prove is a technical term, to do with proofs, which are sequences of formulas
2021-09-29 11:10:02	brownorange	so the scheme of transforming wffs into numbers or backward, is merely decidable?
2021-09-29 11:10:04	mornfall	it doesn't make sense to construct a sequence of formulas that prove that something is a formula
2021-09-29 11:10:27	brownorange	wff is relative to the formal language though
2021-09-29 11:10:46	brownorange	something should be grammatically correct or not
2021-09-29 11:10:52	W	mornfall, I was considering all possible future mathematics, but you're right of course, given a system
2021-09-29 11:11:43	mornfall	brownorange: yes, and well-formedness is indeed a simple, decidable problem; not very interesting

2021-09-29 11:14:58	brownorange	i can easily imagine a math function for this.  f(x)  x is some string, y is some number.  it should be trivial to demonstrate this would work for all math wffs, even if you think math wff is not special than other wffs
2021-09-29 11:15:35	mornfall	i think you should go back to basics… this is starting to resemble a word salad

2021-09-29 11:16:36	mornfall	‘math function’, ‘math wff’ and so on could mean anything; you really need to be a lot more rigorous if you want to argue about decidability, or metamathematics, or whatever
2021-09-29 11:17:21	brownorange	that is another problem. i don't think math should merge the tools used to study the subject with the subject to be studied
2021-09-29 11:18:12	brownorange	i think metamathematics on such a thing leads to word salad
2021-09-29 11:18:25	brownorange	note: I am not an expert
2021-09-29 11:18:32	mornfall	right, so what do you propose? we invent meaningless terms and make vague claims, because using rigorous language is too mathematical to talk about mathematics?

2021-09-29 11:19:53	mornfall	formulas, formal languages, arithmetic encoding, decidability/computability are all well-developed subjects, you just need to study them
2021-09-29 11:20:17	mornfall	there is no single monolithic ‘math’
2021-09-29 11:20:40	brownorange	i don't mean to be a crank about this, but the proper way to study them would be math no?
2021-09-29 11:20:48	mornfall	it's not a single all-encompassing formal system, there is no such thing as a ‘math formula’ or ‘math function’
2021-09-29 11:21:25	brownorange	mornfall you still merge the proof system with the actual math stuff. it doesn't matter you work in weaker of stronger parts
2021-09-29 11:21:25	mornfall	people often include these things in math, sure
2021-09-29 11:21:53	mornfall	but it's not real analysis
2021-09-29 11:23:26	brownorange	i should probably just asnwer your question on what i propose
2021-09-29 11:25:04	brownorange	i have to compare to computer programs again. in a computer program you do not burden yourself with all constructs of the language. you pick and choose. similarly you do not burden yourself with every use of an algorithm.
2021-09-29 11:25:36	brownorange	in math however it seems it's all merged?
2021-09-29 11:26:05	mornfall	no, it's not

2021-09-29 11:39:04	brownorange	still the formal language lets you state any wff you want. i don't care if you think real analysis in unrelated to some other field or not. this is very tautological, either it's a wff or not. and i'm telling you which you can express is entirely a fact about the formal language
2021-09-29 11:39:10	mornfall	that's where the definitions and axioms (say, eg., the axiomatic definition of real numbers) come in
2021-09-29 11:39:37	W	it feels like studying the foundations of mathematics was a mistake, but I'm sure there were useful results too
2021-09-29 11:40:30	mornfall	brownorange: still, turing machines let you state any program you want; i don't care if you think python is unrelated to some other programming language or not. this is very tautological, it's either a program or not. and i'm telling you which you can express is entirely a fact about turing machines
2021-09-29 11:41:35	mornfall	(this is actually much more true about programming languages than it is about math)
2021-09-29 11:41:56	mornfall	(especially considering that programming languages are a small part of math, in this context)
2021-09-29 11:42:04	brownorange	mornfall, your point appears to be you don't need to assume the entire system, and can work from a lesser one to study some other part of math. that's nice. but when you provide THE formalization for math, you suffer THE incompleteness thereof
2021-09-29 11:42:44	W	there is no such suffering
2021-09-29 11:42:49	mornfall	maybe incompleteness means something else than you imagine?
2021-09-29 11:42:51	nagefire	brownorange why is incompleteness so bad?
2021-09-29 11:43:01	W	mathematicians generally don't bump into the incompleteness theorem, they have to actively seek it out
2021-09-29 11:43:06	nagefire	if anything, it lends credibility to math
2021-09-29 11:43:14	mornfall	because all that it means is that there are true statements that cannot be proved
2021-09-29 11:43:34	nagefire	and that is a problem why?
2021-09-29 11:43:39	mornfall	which is perhaps unfortunate, but we can live with it
2021-09-29 11:43:53	brownorange	nagefire, there are a few reasons why incompleteness is bad. but to nip this in the bud, we should think we're brave for fighting dragons not potholes.

2021-09-29 11:46:19	brownorange	@mornfall if you argue for incompleteness because it makes math exciting or worth doing, then i'm telling you that's not an objective reason.

2021-09-29 11:46:54	mornfall	brownorange: you can't ‘argue for incompletness’ … it's a fact
2021-09-29 11:46:54	brownorange	@W you're making my point
2021-09-29 11:47:08	W	brownorange, so why are you talking about incompleteness again?
2021-09-29 11:47:23	brownorange	mornfall some will say that the expressiveness of math is owed to the incompleteness or vice versa
2021-09-29 11:47:35	mornfall	formal systems with such and such properties contain true statements that cannot be proved
2021-09-29 11:48:00	mornfall	most of math happens (or can be made to happen) in such a system
2021-09-29 11:48:09	W	brownorange, being able to prove the incompleteness theorem for a system takes a certain minimum complexity of the system, that is all
2021-09-29 11:48:35	W	this is not some stamp of approval or anything, it's just how it works

2021-09-29 11:51:12	brownorange	let's be a little more precise. you find the possibility of undecidable formulas to be necessary. some find such things exciting
2021-09-29 11:51:30	W	brownorange, it seems like you thought we're working with subsets of mathematics specifically to avoid the incompleteness theorem being applicable to our work, or at least see it as a happy coincidence, but this isn't reality; most mathematics is done without ever even thinking about the incompleteness theorem, and having it pointed out will do nothing to their work
2021-09-29 11:52:24	brownorange	i've heard people positively argue math is better of with incompleteness, and i'm saying the reason has to be more thought out.

2021-09-29 11:52:54	brownorange	hence fight dragons not potholes.
2021-09-29 11:53:00	mornfall	brownorange: so is incompleteness the reason why you think arguments about math should be done without math?
2021-09-29 11:53:38	brownorange	@mornfall no. math also can't be proven consistent, that's really the nail in the coffin

2021-09-29 11:54:18	nagefire	brownorange can it be disproven that math is consistent?
2021-09-29 11:54:22	W	brownorange, what probably has happened is that people have argued against some proposal to do mathematics with a system where incompleteness can't be proven; such systems are very simple indeed and not very general

2021-09-29 12:01:12	W	brownorange, the incompleteness theorem talks about features of math-like systems /in general/; the choice of a specific system isn't the point, the point is that any choice of system leads to the same conclusion. You can't just redefine what mathematics is and avoid it, without entirely making it un-math-like (e.g. say that archaeology is now named "math")

2021-09-29 12:41:23	W	brownorange, I guess a more relevant question is; are you competent to write your proposed formalism? How is it progressing? If you are suggesting someone else do it for you, how will you convince them to, if they all believe differently from you?
2021-09-29 12:41:25	PlanckWalk	They're just polynomials with the question "does this have an integer zero"

2021-09-29 12:59:27	W	if there was a largest prime, there would be finite primes, and we could multiply all the primes together and take the next higher number than that, and find its prime factors, but those cannot be any of the finite primes we already multiplied so must be just itself, a prime larger than the largest prime, and so since the assumption of a largest prime lead to a contradiction, there are infinite primes

2021-09-29 13:01:21	W	lacks formalism, doesn't define what adding one means, or show why this means a factorization can't include the primes, it's still a decent proof

2021-09-29 13:53:31	PlanckWalk	Yep, every node corresponds with a finite sequence from the union, and you define edges in terms of the sequences.  These are all constructions in ZF

2021-09-29 15:37:33	riv	oh ok

2021-09-29 15:38:19	cart_man	70 -84 = 14
2021-09-29 15:38:26	cart_man	at least give it a try
2021-09-29 15:38:28	cart_man	-14`
2021-09-29 15:38:29	riv	you could also solve this by factoring 70 and checking all the divisors
2021-09-29 15:38:31	Koen	cart_man: 84 = 70+14 = 7*10 + 7*2 = 7*12 = 14*6

2021-09-29 15:38:58	riv	so just check 7, 2 and 5 only 7 and 2 work. so 7*2 is the biggest number
2021-09-29 15:39:40	cart_man	Well I would have usually minusd the biggest from the smallest and chekc if I cna divide with the difference. Usually works but I haven;t done math in 5 or so years soo

2021-10-03 15:58:54	cherim	Give me the integral that yields E(1/B_1^2)
2021-10-03 15:59:29	CuriousErnestBro	E[1/B_s^2] should be allowed, it's just \int_{-\infty}^\infty 1/B_s^2 f(x)dx with f(x) the pdf of the normal and that integral you can call g(s)
2021-10-03 15:59:39	CuriousErnestBro	B_1 has a standard normal distribution
2021-10-03 15:59:53	cherim	So spell it out

2021-10-03 16:03:01	CuriousErnestBro	cherim do you mean the variance goes to 0 for s=0 and 1/0 isn't defined?
2021-10-03 16:03:26	cherim	Your g(s) is the normalization integral
2021-10-03 16:03:48	cherim	The average is then int_{-inf}^inf 1/(sqrt(s)* sqrt(2*pi)) e^{-0.5 * x^2/s} dx / x^2, right?
2021-10-03 16:03:55	cherim	I added 1/x^2
2021-10-03 16:03:59	CuriousErnestBro	yes
2021-10-03 16:04:29	CuriousErnestBro	shouldn't /x^2 be inside the integral?
2021-10-03 16:04:30	cherim	So do you think this integral defines some quantity? Doesn't it diverge by a huge margin near x=0?
2021-10-03 16:04:43	cherim	It's (dx/x^2) inside
2021-10-03 16:05:06	cherim	Locally it's const/x^2 near 0
2021-10-03 16:05:08	CuriousErnestBro	how? E(X) = int x f(x) dx
2021-10-03 16:05:35	CuriousErnestBro	so E(1/X) = int 1/x f(x) dx
2021-10-03 16:06:02	cherim	You already have the explicit formula which I agree with

2021-10-03 16:06:31	CuriousErnestBro	why are you doing dx/x^2?
2021-10-03 16:06:46	cherim	Because you need 1/B^2
2021-10-03 16:06:48	CuriousErnestBro	the x^2 isn't supposed to be there, it should be inside the integral
2021-10-03 16:07:04	CuriousErnestBro	Yes, E(1/X) = int 1/x f(x) dx
2021-10-03 16:07:07	cherim	Nothing is outside the integral here
2021-10-03 16:07:08	CuriousErnestBro	what you're saying is different

2021-10-03 16:08:22	cherim	It's integration variable, it can't be outside

2021-10-03 16:15:41	CuriousErnestBro	Yes, that part is clear
2021-10-03 16:15:48	cherim	The convergence of the integral over s is not even posed

2021-10-03 19:39:38	Nickssen	I am asked if the function f(z) = { z^5  /   ||z||^4  for all z =! ,  = 0 for z =0 }  has a derivative at 0, and if it satisfies Cauchy-riemann
2021-10-03 19:40:45	Nickssen	I put z in polar form and reduced the quotient to re^(i5 theta), and then put it in this form  r(cos(5theta) + isin(5theta))  which would be u(r,theta) + iv(r,theta)
2021-10-03 19:41:01	Nickssen	it doesn't satisfy polar cauchy riemann eqs., except when the radius is 0
2021-10-03 19:41:31	Nickssen	could I argument that because it doesnt satisfy cauchy riemann in a neighbourhood of 0, then it's not differentiable at 0?

2021-10-03 19:44:26	rubiksdream	would this be correct? if E_1,E_2 are open+connected subsets of C U {infinity}, and I have a homeomorphism f : E_1->E_2, then given an exhausting sequence of compact subsets C_k for E_1 (i.e. C_k are compact subsets of E_1 s.t. any compact subset of E_1 is contained in some C_k, and are increasing), f(C_k) is a exhausting sequence of compact subsets for E_2
2021-10-03 19:44:54	rubiksdream	then if this is true, shouldn't I also get that d(C_k, boundary(E_1)) -> 0, and d(f(C_k), boundary (E_2)) -> 0?
2021-10-03 19:44:55	Z-module	by the way, it's much more common in complex analysis to denote the length of z by |z|, rather than ||z||, but maybe your source is different.
2021-10-03 19:45:06	Z-module	(they mean the same thing)

2021-10-03 19:50:39	Nickssen	also, when they ask if a function f is harmonic, they  mean if u(x,y) and v(x,y) are harmonic, right?
2021-10-03 19:50:45	Nickssen	silly question
2021-10-03 19:51:10	Z-module	hmm, presumably; normally "harmonic" functions are in the context of real-valued things
2021-10-03 19:51:49	Z-module	rubiksdream: isn't your question really just about one set E_1 and any single exhausting sequence of compact subsets?
2021-10-03 19:52:00	Z-module	Not sure what the homeomorphism to E_2 has to do with anything
2021-10-03 19:52:43	Nickssen	thanks Z!!
2021-10-03 19:52:49	rubiksdream	Z-module right, i guess i wanted to know if a sequence of compact subsets is exhausting iff its distance to the boundary tends to 0
2021-10-03 19:52:57	rubiksdream	seems to me like that should be the case

2021-10-03 19:55:06	Z-module	rubiksdream: distance -> 0 does not imply exhausting. Just imagine E_1 being an open disk, C_1 is some narrow closed annulus co-centered inside E_1, and now grow C_1's outer boundary a little bit more but leave the inner boundary alone, to get C_2, etc like that
2021-10-03 19:55:30	rubiksdream	oh yes, you're right
2021-10-03 19:55:48	rubiksdream	so exhausting is strictly stronger than distance -> 0
2021-10-03 19:56:13	rubiksdream	then the question i wanted to ask becomes, does exhausting -> distance to boundary goes to zero
2021-10-03 19:56:18	Z-module	I believe so

So let's assume b is actually sqrt(c) so you get a^3 + 3a^2 sqrt(c) + 3a c + csqrt(c), so let's try to put 20 + 14sqrt(2) in that form: a = 3 wouldn't work since a^3 = 27, so we go with a = 2 for now: 8 + 3 * 4 * sqrt(2) + 3 * 2 * 2 + 2 sqrt(2) which all adds nicely to 20 + 14sqrt(2)

So we can take a groupoid with 33 non-isomorphic objects each of which has 2 symmetries. Though they all would then be isomorphic, wouldn’t they?.. oh

2021-10-03 22:36:35	arseniiv	of course we need to make sure compositions are definable the correct way. Let’s say each object in an isomorphy class of N have 2 N morphisms to all of them, N “identity” ones (including the identity to itself) and N “inverse” ones, each pair of those giving an “identity”, so it’s possible okay

2021-10-03 23:48:04	brownorange	(((a or not b) nor c) implies c)   has truth density 7/8 or 87.5%  whereas not (((a or not b) nor c) implies c) has 1/8 or 12.5% truth density.  neither are a tautology so l.e.m (a or not a) does not hold forall a

2021-10-03 23:49:26	brownorange	it therefore seems unfair to apply completeness to all wffs since not even prop-calc obeys l.e.m
2021-10-03 23:52:15	arseniiv	brownorange: but LEM is “|= (a or not a)”, not “(|= a) or (|= not a)”
2021-10-03 23:52:15	brownorange	if the 19th century result is proof is not truth because proving a or not a isn't possible for every wff, then we should also see that  every constructible wff never obeyed l.e.m in the first place.

2021-10-04 00:09:21	brownorange	yes but you're trying to think of a row in the truth table where atleast one true exists in either 'a' or not 'a' case
2021-10-04 00:09:28	arseniiv	initially I thought you don’t agree LEM works
2021-10-04 00:09:44	arseniiv	no, I don’t think like that
2021-10-04 00:10:15	arseniiv	just so for every row either a or not a is true, so (a or not a) is true whenever, so |= (a or not a)
2021-10-04 00:10:56	brownorange	i think that's what i find to be an issue? because the formula with truth density i'm evaluating has a reason for the truth rows being true/false
2021-10-04 00:11:31	brownorange	not (((a or not b) nor c) implies c)     has one truth row as true, the rest is false.   you can't just pick which is true , since some rows are false.
2021-10-04 00:12:26	arseniiv	we don’t pick, why?
2021-10-04 00:12:38	arseniiv	we take all rows of (prop or (no prop))
2021-10-04 00:12:47	brownorange	because why pick a 'T' row over a 'F' row?
2021-10-04 00:12:48	arseniiv	all of them would end up true
2021-10-04 00:12:57	brownorange	oh
2021-10-04 00:13:08	arseniiv	we don’t pick rows for (prop) and (not prop) separately :)
2021-10-04 00:13:52	arseniiv	we look at the megaprop of the form (prop or (not prop)) as a whole
2021-10-04 00:13:57	brownorange	you're thinking of a different l.e.m arseniiv.  where something is itself or is not itself.  either I have a balloon or i do not have a balloon
2021-10-04 00:14:41	brownorange	propositional l.e.m is about truths not random objects

2021-10-04 01:28:48	W	brownorange, the question was why you think one "models" the other, where have you heard that, who told you, how did you deduce it, what does "model" mean in that deduction?
2021-10-04 01:28:55	somiaj	cuppajoeman: there is nothing in any of those statements to state that for all a,b in A, that (a,b) in R or (b,a) in R -- nothing requires that so far
2021-10-04 01:29:14	cuppajoeman	Ok, and so the element ({1, 2}, {1, 3, 5}) is not in R
2021-10-04 01:29:25	somiaj	cuppajoeman: so it is more that the definition of partial order doesn't force all things to be comparable, which allows for the option things are not comparable (such as my subset example)
2021-10-04 01:29:25	W	brownorange, well, what do you think of (a and not a)
2021-10-04 01:29:26	cuppajoeman	And neither is ({1, 3, 5}, {1, 2})
2021-10-04 01:29:32	somiaj	cuppajoeman: correct
2021-10-04 01:29:46	cuppajoeman	Ok I see now
2021-10-04 01:29:52	robototo60	@dila yes, i am not sure what the process is to give the result x(x^n - 1)/(n(x-1))
2021-10-04 01:30:15	cuppajoeman	Ok linear order
2021-10-04 01:30:24	somiaj	cuppajoeman: then linear now forces things to be comparable, for all a,b in A, either (a,b) in R or (b,a) in R, but we just prefer to write it as a<=b instead of (a,b) in R
2021-10-04 01:30:30	brownorange	@W if you look at the truth table for each binary operator you'll notice a pattern. it is asking a question on inputs and returning an answer that says yes/no that the two inputs satisfy the operation.
2021-10-04 01:30:41	somiaj	cuppajoeman: so a partial order can be a tree (Think of subsets)
2021-10-04 01:31:26	somiaj	cuppajoeman: https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/afteracademy-server-uploads/print-all-subsets-of-a-given-set-recursion-tree-9bbcd4be963c54c8.jpg see how the subset partial order creates a tree of what is subset of other things?
2021-10-04 01:31:27	cuppajoeman	subsets?
2021-10-04 01:31:31	W	brownorange, yes, for each "interpretation" of the operation (as a formula) as you clarified earlier.
2021-10-04 01:31:31	dila	robototo60: it is my undertsanding that there is no systematic way to arrive at that kind of closed form expression from the summation expression. i could be wrong. what i am sure about is that give the original input expression and the closed form expression, you can prove that they are equal (maybe by induction)
2021-10-04 01:31:35	brownorange	@W input1=true,input2=true,   now take input1 and input2, this would return affirmative that input1 and input2  is a correct use of and
2021-10-04 01:32:11	W	brownorange, indeed, and "input1 and input2" itself isn't sufficient to deduce its truth value
2021-10-04 01:32:20	cuppajoeman	So the parent node is a subset of all it's children
2021-10-04 01:32:23	dila	robototo60: the ability to check the solution at least gives you the opportunity to make a guess at the solution, and there may be some structured guessing that could be called a systematic process.
2021-10-04 01:32:27	Z-module	cuppajoeman: you can even have a poset (partially ordered set) where *no* two distinct things are comparable.
2021-10-04 01:32:30	brownorange	@W propositional l.e.m appears to suggest you can do something very different. you can declare that one or the other is true by their affect on each other.
2021-10-04 01:32:31	W	because there is nothing else relating the two independent inputs
2021-10-04 01:32:52	cuppajoeman	So then the poset is empty?
2021-10-04 01:32:58	Z-module	no, it has the elements
2021-10-04 01:33:01	cuppajoeman	except maybe (a,a)
2021-10-04 01:33:12	W	if you say "input1 and input1" we can now deduce that the truth value of this is just "input1" because the two inputs to the operator are related
2021-10-04 01:33:14	somiaj	cuppajoeman: So now a linear order (Since everything is comparable) you must be able to put all of your objects in a line, such that things to the left are always smaller than things to the right.
2021-10-04 01:33:40	somiaj	cuppajoeman: think of the integers, you can order them in a line with standard <=, or the real number line, it orders everything so points on the left are always <= points on the right
2021-10-04 01:33:52	cuppajoeman	Is that coming from transitivity?
2021-10-04 01:33:55	brownorange	@W but is {a, !a}  really related?

2021-10-04 01:34:13	somiaj	cuppajoeman: a combiation of transitivity and everything must be comprable
2021-10-04 01:34:16	W	brownorange, yes, !a is wholly determined by a
2021-10-04 01:34:21	cuppajoeman	I see

2021-10-04 01:34:36	somiaj	cuppajoeman: ready for what 'dense' means?
2021-10-04 01:34:37	Z-module	well, visualizing things as a line is rather informal. For example, the ordinal aleph_1 is certainly a linear ordering, but there is no order-preserving injection of it into (R, <).
2021-10-04 01:34:41	brownorange	@W I disagree.   !a could be any that is not a.
2021-10-04 01:34:51	cuppajoeman	Yes

2021-10-04 01:35:17	somiaj	cuppajoeman: dense means that for any a < b (this means a<=b and a!=b), there exists c such that a < c < b
2021-10-04 01:35:27	robototo60	thank you @dila!
2021-10-04 01:35:30	W	brownorange, like I said, mathematics is a game, we make up our own rules. This is part of the rules that almost everyone else play by; you're free to make up your own rules (or subscribe to some minority alternative)
2021-10-04 01:35:36	cuppajoeman	So Q is dense because you can take (b-a)/2
2021-10-04 01:35:38	somiaj	cuppajoeman: so the integers are not dense, because there is no integer between 3 and 4.
2021-10-04 01:35:46	cuppajoeman	Yeah
2021-10-04 01:35:51	W	brownorange, normally we don't say we "disagree" though, because it's just a choice, not a belief
2021-10-04 01:35:55	somiaj	cuppajoeman: but here it is about the order (not the objects, you can actually put lots of different orders on Q)
2021-10-04 01:36:17	somiaj	cuppajoeman: but yes, Q with the standard order is dense
2021-10-04 01:36:27	cuppajoeman	Oh ok, so the standard order is the less than or equal to relation
2021-10-04 01:36:32	Z-module	cuppajoeman: if you are ever stuck at a bus or train stop with a long boring wait, try to think of an order-preserving bijection Q -> Q\{0}
2021-10-04 01:36:39	brownorange	@W suppose you had {x,y,z,w} that are true, and {e,f,g,h} that are false.    '!x' would imply  all of {e,f,g,h}, therefore 'x' it is not necessarily related to 'x'
2021-10-04 01:36:52	somiaj	cuppajoeman: and last no end points, means for all a there exists b and c such that b < a < c (there is no minimial or maximial element in this order)
2021-10-04 01:37:07	W	brownorange, yes it is
2021-10-04 01:37:29	W	brownorange, that's why we use letters instead of single dots
2021-10-04 01:37:29	brownorange	@W this how prop-calc does business. when two things do not have the same truth, they are as separate as can be. thus the relation of 'x' to '!x' isn't very strong.  so we can't be seduced by the power of it

2021-10-04 01:38:39	W	brownorange, who told you this?
2021-10-04 01:38:41	cuppajoeman	Z-module: Does order preserving mean that if (a, b) in R then ( f(a), f(b) ) in R?
2021-10-04 01:38:42	somiaj	cuppajoeman: so Q is such a thing that meets your criteria
2021-10-04 01:38:52	brownorange	@W my observations of using the logic
2021-10-04 01:39:21	Z-module	cuppajoeman: yes, and here, R is just the usual < order on Q
2021-10-04 01:39:29	cuppajoeman	Thank you
2021-10-04 01:39:35	somiaj	cuppajoeman: but there are tons of other things that could be similar, countable number of objects, which are ordered in a linear fashion, such that this order is is both dense and has no end points
2021-10-04 01:39:56	W	(a or b) depends on b, if you make a table of the two with all possible combinations of true and false as rows, some of the rows are invalid interpretations of the formula, logic says that it's not a valid truth table, it contains a contradiction

2021-10-04 01:40:53	brownorange	@W fair point. but if b is substituted with the negation of 'a', we can say more interestingly 'a' is separate from '!a' and vice versa
2021-10-04 01:41:14	somiaj	actually wait, I think I might need to be careful there, I think you can find things no isomorphic to Q, but my example I think is isomorphic to Q
2021-10-04 01:41:21	W	brownorange, when you write a truth table for "a or b", you have four rows, right? But there are three boolean choices for each row, why not eight rows?
2021-10-04 01:41:39	Z-module	somiaj: I ultimately came around to the opinion that the standard theorem "Every countably infinite dense linear ordering without endpoints is order-isomorphic to Q" isn't as complete as it should be. I much prefer:  "Every countably infinite dense linear ordering is order-isomorphic to a unique thing in the list:  Q cap (0,1),  Q cap [0,1),  Q cap (0,1],  Q cap [0,1] "
2021-10-04 01:42:00	dila	W: you're saying you would include the result/output of the boolean function in the table too?
2021-10-04 01:42:02	Z-module	(that is: Q, or Q with a left endpoint adjoined, or Q with a right endpoint adjoined, or Q with both)
2021-10-04 01:42:07	brownorange	@W not sure what you mean by 3 choices. what are the 3 choices?
2021-10-04 01:42:23	cuppajoeman	Ok, so countable and dense is a property about the set your relation is defined upon and linear order is a property about the relation itself?
2021-10-04 01:42:26	W	dila, I am making a rhetorical and/or pedagogic argument
2021-10-04 01:42:35	W	brownorange, the three columns
2021-10-04 01:42:44	somiaj	cuppajoeman: dense is actually a property of the relation/order
2021-10-04 01:42:54	somiaj	cuppajoeman: but countable is a property of the set
2021-10-04 01:42:59	Z-module	"countable" is purely about the set itself; "dense" is about the specific linear ordering on it

2021-10-04 01:43:16	cuppajoeman	"dense means that for any a < b (this means a<=b and a!=b), there exists c such that a < c < b" so here < is a relation

2021-10-04 01:45:35	brownorange	@W why would you say 8?
2021-10-04 01:45:59	dila	the number of rows is 2^n for n columns
2021-10-04 01:46:09	W	because 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 are eight combinations of 0 or 1 for false or true

2021-10-04 01:48:46	somiaj	move a infinte subset of the order to just bigger than everyting by default

2021-10-04 02:03:02	brownorange	@W because the truth table is constructed around the output in relation to the inputs, not also each separately and together.
2021-10-04 02:03:34	W	brownorange, what I'm trying to communicate here is that an expression, like !a, does not itself have an independent truth value. Its value /depends/ on the variables included in it
2021-10-04 02:04:43	W	(a or !b or c or d or !e) in the same way depends on the five variables included, it is not independent. !(a or !b or c or d or !e) also depends on these five variables, and in fact depends on (a or !b or c or d or !e) itself

2021-10-04 02:06:39	brownorange	@W I think I agree.  but what !a manifests is still potentially different than 'a' by itself. notice that both are established before we do the inclusive-or operation. it's not like this is a singularity of var creation and logical computation
2021-10-04 02:06:41	W	when you fill out a truth table with all of these expressions and variables, you do indeed not have all the boolean combinations, because that's not how logic works, by common agreement and history establishing such
2021-10-04 02:07:23	W	brownorange, yes, !a is its own thing, it's just, this thing is dependent on a, and we can relate it to the value of a, and when the two are used in one expression this allows us to make deduction via the agreed upon rules of logic
2021-10-04 02:07:51	W	one of those rules of logic is the law of excluded middle, stating that (a or !a) is true, no matter what we might think or know or have deduced or not about a
2021-10-04 02:08:14	brownorange	is your point that (a or not a)  does not imply we've demonstrated either a, !a ?

2021-10-04 02:12:50	isekaijin	Hello. I am analyzing the Du Val singularities of type A_n. They are locally isomorphic to C^2 / G, where C is the cyclic group of n+1 elements acting on C^2 by (x,y) |-> (kx, y/k), where k is an (n+1)-th root of unity. I have shown that a polynomial in C[x,y] is G-invariant if and only if its individual terms are G-invariant, and a monomial x^a y^b is G-invariant if and only if a-b is divisible by
2021-10-04 02:12:52	isekaijin	n+1. Thus, the G-invariant monomials are of the form u^a v^b w^c, where u = x^(n+1), v = y^(n+1), w = xy.
2021-10-04 02:13:33	brownorange	Not A implies Not A, but it implies way more than that.
2021-10-04 02:14:38	brownorange	because of what prop-calc is the real difference comes down to truth. that's it.  (a or not !a)  should convince us of anything

2021-10-04 02:16:48	isekaijin	Clearly, f(u,v,w) = u^2 y^2 - w^(n+1) always vanishes at every (u,v,w). I want to show that any other polynomial that vanishes at every (u,v,w) is a multiple of f. I have done so in a rather crude way.

2021-10-04 02:19:03	brownorange	it's sad i'm not an intuitionist but i appear to be making intuitionist arguments
2021-10-04 02:19:24	isekaijin	Namely, f is irreducible, hence V(f) is an irreducible surface in C^3. If there were another polynomial g (not a multiple of f) vanishing at every (u,v,w), then our orbit space C^2 / G would be containedin V(f,g), which is necessarily a curve. But, C^2 / G has to be a surface, because C[x,y] is an integral extension of C[x,y]^G, hence C^2 / G has the same dimension as C^2, which is 2.
2021-10-04 02:21:03	W	brownorange, I explicitly made an anti-intuitionist argument earlier, paraphrasing Hilbert, and you didn't react or disagree, so perhaps not a very good one :p
2021-10-04 02:22:49	isekaijin	I am not too satified with this approach “in broad strokes” to showing that f suffices to generate the polynomial relations among u,v,w. Is it possible to do this with a more straightforward calculation? Not appealing to generalities about topological dimension or the theory of integral extensions.
2021-10-04 02:23:06	W	(I misread that as you saying that perhaps you're an intuitionist)

2021-10-04 04:25:24	PlanckWalk	[itchyjunk]: You want to disprove "there exists L such that for all epsilon > 0 there exists delta > 0 such that |z - z0| < delta implies |f(z) - L| < epsilon.
2021-10-04 04:25:28	brownorange	good news everyone (a or not a) is a tautology afterall!
2021-10-04 04:25:30	cuppajoeman	If its the opposite direction
2021-10-04 04:25:31	[itchyjunk]	so i have lim z->z_0 f(z)/(z-z_0) - f(z_0)/z-z_0

2021-10-04 04:26:13	PlanckWalk	Sinc eyou already used f.  Then let g(z) = f(z) / (z - z0)
2021-10-04 04:26:37	cuppajoeman	If I have an order preserving function from Q to A does that mean I have an order preserving function from A to Q?

2021-10-04 20:56:47	buster	LiftLeft, the usual Voronoi algorithm should work. You'll use the 3d version of the algorithm, then translate the resulting planes into great circles. The planes will all pass through the centre of the sphere provided the input points are all on the surface of the sphere.
2021-10-04 21:00:50	buster	transforming the collection of great circles into a collection of spherical polygons might be quite painful if you want to do it programatically for arbitrary inputs. but not dramatically harder conceptually than it already is for the simple case of points in a flat 2d plane.

2021-10-04 22:59:15	W	When looking at the relative phases (arguments) of (harmonic) frequencies in a Fourier transform of a periodic signal, it is dependent on the time picked as 0. Will multiplying the Fourier transform by e^(iPf) (where P is the period, f the frequency) correctly correct for this, so the phase difference between frequencies becomes independent of time shift? I think so but my brain is in low gear atm.

2021-10-04 23:56:44	cuppajoeman	WHen it was introduced to me they said the principle of well ordering is that every finite subset of the natural numbers has a least element

2021-10-04 23:57:10	Z-module	that's wrong
2021-10-04 23:57:15	cuppajoeman	Oh ok
2021-10-04 23:57:38	Z-module	in a linear ordering, every nonempty subset has a least element, period. That's independent of well-ordering.
2021-10-04 23:57:47	Z-module	sorry, every finite nonempty subset
2021-10-04 23:58:14	Z-module	for example, every finite subset does in the example I write a minute ago
2021-10-04 23:58:22	Z-module	but the set as a whole has no least element
2021-10-04 23:58:45	cuppajoeman	And least element in this case means that there is an element a in the subset st a R x for every other x in the subset?
2021-10-04 23:58:51	Z-module	yes
2021-10-04 23:59:37	cuppajoeman	So your example
2021-10-04 23:59:44	cuppajoeman	5 << 4 << 3 << 2 << 1 << 0
2021-10-05 00:00:01	cuppajoeman	Then if you take a finite subset of N
2021-10-05 00:00:07	Z-module	I should clarify: it's not wrong to say that every finite subset of N (usual ordering) has a least element, if it's nonempty. But that's purely by N being a linear ordering, nothing to do with it being a well-ordering.
2021-10-05 00:00:16	cuppajoeman	Yeah
2021-10-05 00:00:45	cuppajoeman	I untuitively understand that we can find such a least element since we can compare each element
2021-10-05 00:00:51	cuppajoeman	since it's a linear order
2021-10-05 00:01:24	cuppajoeman	But that implies that there is one that is "left related" to each other element?

2021-10-05 00:25:25	Z-module	Not sure what you quite intend by "direct". Consider this: list all the distinct elements x_1, ..., x_n  in some arbitrary order. Now set m = x_1. If n is 1, then this m is the smallest (only) element. Otherwise, check which of m <= x_2, x_2 <= m holds -- exactly one must be true. In the latter case only, redefine m to be x_2.  If n = 2 we're done, otherwise, consider which of m <= x_3, x_3 <= m holds; etc.   At the end of these
2021-10-05 00:25:25	Z-module	finitely many steps, m will be the smallest element.

2021-10-05 00:46:19	cuppajoeman	I saw some proof of it where they took the binomial distribution and took n to infinity
2021-10-05 00:47:01	cuppajoeman	https://i.imgur.com/wDV5jcf.png
2021-10-05 00:47:01	qergle	proof of what?
2021-10-05 00:47:26	qergle	they "motivate" not prove
2021-10-05 00:47:31	cuppajoeman	Ah ok
2021-10-05 00:47:47	qergle	to make you think of infinite very biased coins
2021-10-05 00:47:56	qergle	does that help?
2021-10-05 00:48:08	cuppajoeman	I think I just starting to understand it
2021-10-05 00:48:09	qergle	i can't imagine flipping coins infintely. my hand would get tired.
2021-10-05 00:48:31	cuppajoeman	So can use possion in cases like this: https://i.imgur.com/WeQGCOx.png
2021-10-05 00:48:43	cuppajoeman	Because we are thinking of time as passing
2021-10-05 00:48:54	qergle	i believe the best way to motivate would be using arrival times, or the like.
2021-10-05 00:49:07	cuppajoeman	and every second there's a chance that that a call arrives
2021-10-05 00:49:17	cuppajoeman	but it's very low?
2021-10-05 00:49:27	qergle	then poisson becomes a useful way to model these arrival time things
2021-10-05 00:50:09	qergle	like a bus arrival, or customers arriving to ##math to get some delicious help, or people arriving to tim hortons

2021-10-05 00:50:55	cuppajoeman	ok cool. So in that question they also seem to specify some time interval?
2021-10-05 00:50:58	qergle	hard to get motivated thinking about a super-biased coin getting flipped forever.
2021-10-05 00:51:45	qergle	ok, so two per minute, what's your λ
2021-10-05 00:52:12	cuppajoeman	So they're saying lambda represents the rate - not sure why yet - but in that case lambda = 2?

2021-10-05 01:01:01	ℹ	xeno__ is now known as xeno
2021-10-05 01:01:35	cuppajoeman	I think that if the rate lambda is measured in minutes so 2/minute, then I think we need to pass in P(C = x) where x is measured in minutes as well
2021-10-05 01:01:44	qergle	also, P(C=something not an integer) is going to be trouble

2021-10-05 01:03:20	qergle	why not set a unit of time that makes answering easiest?
2021-10-05 01:03:25	cuppajoeman	Ok, let's make our time interval 2 minutes
2021-10-05 01:03:36	qergle	ok, now what is λ?
2021-10-05 01:03:45	cuppajoeman	In that case calls are arriving at a rate of 4 per 2 minute
2021-10-05 01:03:56	cuppajoeman	So then our rate is lambda = 4
2021-10-05 01:04:17	cuppajoeman	Now we can compute P(C = 5)

2021-10-06 16:00:43	twJizhan	is { the number of non-isomorphic groups having positive integer n elements : n = 1,2,3,... } equal to {positive integers} ?
2021-10-06 16:01:20	mornfall	twJizhan: are you asking if there is a group of every possible size?

2021-10-06 16:01:39	twJizhan	yes!
2021-10-06 16:02:24	mornfall	then the answer is yes, take the cyclic groups
2021-10-06 16:02:32	mornfall	integers modulo n with addition
2021-10-06 16:02:45	cherim	No, the question is different

2021-10-06 16:05:11	mornfall	i mean, the bit about non-isomorphic in the original phrasing is confusing
2021-10-06 16:05:11	cherim	The set of numbers occurring in https://oeis.org/A000001 or not?

2021-10-06 18:20:20	Z-module	An occasionally handy fact: In every R^n, every open set is a countable union of "non-overlapping" n-boxes meaning sets of the form [a_1,b_1] x ... x [a_n,b_n]   and non-overlapping means no two of those boxes have any interior points in common. You can specify that they all be cubes if you like, and that all the corner coordinates (the a_i and the b_i) all come from some specified dense subset of R, such as Q.

2021-10-06 21:06:27	[itchyjunk]	interesting that this is called "formal derivative", so the one from the calc might be informal derivative

Suppose you have a probability measure composed of a sum of N diracs at positions p_i (1<=i<=N). The the measure is like P(x) = (1/N)sum_i delta(x - p_i). I'm trying to describe a "derivative" of the density of this measure wrt p_i. It looks to me like the weak derivative should just be 0, but is there any notion

2021-10-06 22:19:39	anovick	hmm I think in this case there the only eigenvalue M^2 is going to have is 2^2, and M^2 has no other eigenvalues because if there were then they their square root was a eigenvalue of M, whereas M only has 2 as eigenvalue
2021-10-06 22:20:31	anovick	and since M^2 is order of 3x3 the degree of the polynomial is going to be 3 so there really isn't any other choice for (t-2^2)^i except i=3

Apply binomial, cancle z_0^n. factor out delta_z, cancel it with denominator. Factor out n so I have  lim delta_z -> 0

2021-10-07 17:56:31	Hazey_Dream	So Level 1 is 0 (No EXP is needed to reach previous levels because no previous levels.) + 1 EXP, Level 2 is 1 (1 EXP to reach the previous level, Level 1.) +2....
2021-10-07 17:57:02	Hazey_Dream	& Level 3 is 1 + 3 (Previous two levels) + 3.

2021-10-07 19:36:43	_________	Hazey_Dream: there's big difference - your example suggests it's a "level(n) = n + sum of level(k) for k from 1 to n-1" while the description suggests it's "level(n) = level(n-1) + n"

2021-10-07 20:08:15	Hazey_Dream	What do you mean by how is EXP calculated? I did do a system earlier, where basically the EXP to reach a level is equal to the total EXP to reach the previous levels, plus that level's value. Shown in this Pastebin: https://pastebin.com/Acge4BUH
2021-10-07 20:08:28	[itchyjunk]	i think right, it makes enough sense
2021-10-07 20:08:52	dila	[itchyjunk]: if g(x)=-x and f(x)=e^x, then f(g(x))=e^-x

2021-10-07 20:10:02	Hazey_Dream	It's just a theoretical system that's not actually a part of anything, so if you're asking "How is how much EXP is received calculated", the answer is "Not Applicable, this is only a system to define amounts required to level up".

2021-10-07 20:18:20	Hazey_Dream	In the context of the nonexistent hypothetical system this system to determine amount of EXP to level up, EXP is Experience Points, which would in theory be accumulated via unspecified means. Acquire a total amoubt of EXP (Experience Points) equal to or greater than the requirement for a Level of a given value, & you become the highest of those levels you're elligible for.
2021-10-07 20:19:02	Hazey_Dream	Otherwise, EXP is not based on anything, because this is just an isolated system of determining how much EXP (Theoretically) would be required to reach what level(s).
2021-10-07 20:19:10	dila	Hazey_Dream: but when those means are specified, then EXP is a function of some variables
2021-10-07 20:19:40	Hazey_Dream	Yes, but I don't see the relevance of those variables, given they don't exist & aren't necessary to determine this part of the system
2021-10-07 20:19:41	dila	maybe you gain EXP over time without any action? in that case EXP is a function of time
2021-10-07 20:20:46	Hazey_Dream	We'll say for now, EXP cannot be gained, but what amounts of it are required to become what level still need to be set.
2021-10-07 20:21:37	dila	but if you can gain a level, then you can gain EXP?

Once you...

When you have this, you know that the exceptional divisor is a union of copies of P^1, and you just need to understand how they intersect, and this gives you the dual graph
2021-10-07 22:32:16	isekaijin	Oh, thanks!
2021-10-07 22:32:51	sek	you can try to do the blowups of an (isolated hypersurface) A_n and D_n singularity yourself by hand for small values of n

2021-10-08 01:55:09	sek	I should add that even in geometry/topology we avoid dealing with presheaves by sheafifying, they are not just some unecessary abstraction, they are absolutely integral to very geometric constructions - eg the image presheaf of f:F->G a morphism is not a sheaf, and same for the tensor product, the the construction of an image/tensor "sheaf" is rather involved

2021-10-08 01:57:03	mornfall	presumably with some smoothness of variation condition? dunno
2021-10-08 01:57:06	joel135	PSh(PSh(C)) has a formal interest, because PSh is sort of like a multiset monad. You know, multiset(multiset(X)) -> multiset(X) given by taking unions/sums.
2021-10-08 01:57:37	sek	mornfall: basically yeah, that's the main example of a sheaf - the sheaf of sections of something that looks like a fibre bundle
2021-10-08 01:58:17	mornfall	(i mean, that's what sheaves are described as)
2021-10-08 01:58:37	sek	the nicest fibre bundles are vector bundles, and a vb is exactly the data of what's called a locally free sheaf, namely the sheaf of sections to the vb
2021-10-08 01:59:40	sek	of course the definition of a presheaf is simpler than all this, but I believe this came after people noticed this correspondence with vector bundles

2021-10-08 02:01:15	isekaijin	Yeah, but sheaves are the right notion. It makes sense that if you have local data that agrees on overlaps, you should be able to reconstruct global data.

2021-10-08 02:02:25	Galois	didn't we just answer this question? Natural things that you want to do to sheaves (like images, quotients, etc.) don't produce sheaves
2021-10-08 02:02:48	Galois	they produce presheaves, so you need just enough knowledge of presheaves to know how to turn a presheaf back into a sheaf
2021-10-08 02:02:58	mornfall	ah, right, i remember now; sheaves happen when you relax the requirements on the underlying space to just have a (point-set) topology, but nothing else
2021-10-08 02:03:16	mornfall	so i guess smoothness is out of question there

2021-10-08 12:10:00	brownorange	did i end up in some higher order logic land?
2021-10-08 12:10:43	PlanckWalk	"brownorange: The symbol following "ThereExists" must be a variable."

2021-10-08 12:11:39	PlanckWalk	(Sometimes it must also be a variable name not used outside the scope)
2021-10-08 12:12:15	Simplar	cherim: Now, angle BEA is equal to 30° as EA lies on a median, bisector and height of both isosceles triangle ABC and equilateral triangle BEC. Since triangle BEA has a side and two angles adjacent to it equal to a side and two angles adjacent to it of a triangle BMC, this leads to the conclusion these triangles are congruent
2021-10-08 12:12:40	Simplar	=> MC = AB.
2021-10-08 12:13:01	PlanckWalk	brownorange: If you have some naming convention that distinguishes them, then yes.
2021-10-08 12:13:14	Simplar	Since AB = AC from the initial triangle, we conclude ACM is isosceles with AM = CM.

2021-10-08 12:13:23	brownorange	if the point is to axiomatize formulas we think are true, but having formulas about truth in the axioms is a conflict of interest to an objective formal system, i suppose that makes sense.
2021-10-08 12:13:33	brownorange	is only propositional logic allowed to be about truth?
2021-10-08 12:13:54	PlanckWalk	I don't even know what you mean there

2021-10-08 12:14:59	brownorange	predicate logic is suppose to be about predicates, not what's true. that seems to be the point. whereas propositional logic is perhaps about what's true

2021-10-08 12:15:54	PlanckWalk	Fully quantified predicates *are* propositions.
2021-10-08 12:16:10	brownorange	@PlanckWalk but not about truth, about predicates right?
2021-10-08 12:16:36	cherim	Simplar: Yes, nice solution. Not a really obvious one.
2021-10-08 12:16:56	PlanckWalk	brownorange: I have no idea what you are trying to ask, but it seems confused.
2021-10-08 12:16:56	stanrifkin_	brownorange: i think it always comes down to truth in logic
2021-10-08 12:17:05	Simplar	cherim: My problem with it is that it requires additional construction.
2021-10-08 12:18:08	brownorange	@PlanckWalk predicate logic expresses truths about predicates, not truth about truths, that's what i'm asking, AND therefore that's why the other person said i should avoid" ! forall a (!a <-> True)  <->  ThereExists a  (a <-> True)

2021-10-08 12:20:30	PlanckWalk	brownorange: "Set theory axioms are about sets" in the sense that the elements of the domain of discourse are sets.
2021-10-08 12:20:57	PlanckWalk	"Predicate logic expresses truth about predicates" is *not* the same sense.

2021-10-08 14:03:20	isekaijin	That is beside the point.
2021-10-08 14:03:48	isekaijin	I am just telling you that the book is, in fact, not redefining any standard mathematical symbols. It is only defining new symbols for a new language.
2021-10-08 14:04:33	isekaijin	It is actually good that the new language's symbols are very different from the standard ones.
2021-10-08 14:05:07	isekaijin	Because you will be using standard mathematical language to talk about the new language.
2021-10-08 14:06:07	isekaijin	And it is going to be confusing if you can't tell whether “+” means the standard mathematical addition, or your new language's symbol that happens to be intended for addition.

2021-10-08 15:51:33	brownorange	well C was originally bootstrapped with ASM, then could compile itself thereafter
2021-10-08 15:52:07	brownorange	today C can just be used to improve C compilers
2021-10-08 15:52:23	Gurkenglas	then ASM compiled python into ASM, but that ASM was the compiling language was incidental and everyone wanted to wash their hands of that as soon as possible

2021-10-08 15:53:46	brownorange	unfortunatley there is no actual supermetavar in languages, because different languages have a very different expectation of what a var is

2021-10-08 15:55:18	Gurkenglas	the expectations of a language don't really have a say in what's meta and what isn't because those are labels applied by us from the *cough* super-meta level
2021-10-08 15:56:48	dila	the language itself (as defined by the designers), the code written in the language, a compiler that maps from one language to another

2021-10-08 18:01:56	gas51627	we can ask ourselves why
2021-10-08 18:02:01	gas51627	but I sort of trust this one
2021-10-08 18:02:34	Gurkenglas	This is a property of "add 1", we say that "add 1" is "well-defined".
2021-10-08 18:02:49	gas51627	ok
2021-10-08 18:03:10	Gurkenglas	in symbols, f is well-defined means forall x,y: x=y => f(x)=f(y)
2021-10-08 18:03:25	gas51627	right
2021-10-08 18:03:30	gas51627	in our case f = add 1
2021-10-08 18:03:39	gas51627	f is add 1
2021-10-08 18:03:51	Gurkenglas	"times 2" is also well-defined, and so is "times itself" or "times 0"
2021-10-08 18:04:26	gas51627	btw is "well-definedness" something similar to reflexivity, transitivity , etc
2021-10-08 18:04:27	gas51627	?
2021-10-08 18:05:03	Gurkenglas	sort of!
2021-10-08 18:05:15	gas51627	ok
2021-10-08 18:05:18	Gurkenglas	there's another property of some functions f called "one-to-one" or "bijective": forall x,y: x=y <=> f(x)=f(y)
2021-10-08 18:05:43	Gurkenglas	"add 1" and "times 2" have this, "times itself" and "times 0" don't
2021-10-08 18:06:07	Gurkenglas	because 2=1 is false but 2*0=1*0 is true, so the <= part doesn't hold
2021-10-08 18:06:10	gas51627	right
2021-10-08 18:06:55	gas51627	I think I understand where are you going to
2021-10-08 18:06:59	Gurkenglas	What I want to make clear is that I have heard of "well-defined" and "bijective" and so on long before I connected it to "apply something to both sides", but these are supposed to be right next to each other in your brain!
2021-10-08 18:07:46	gas51627	cool stuff
2021-10-08 18:07:52	Gurkenglas	similarly, f being monotonic means forall x,y: x smaller than y => f(x) smaller than f(y)
2021-10-08 18:07:53	←	Hanii has quit (Quit: Textual IRC Client: www.textualapp.com)
2021-10-08 18:08:22	Gurkenglas	"add 1" and "times 2" are monotonic, "times -2" isn't, and *that's why* you're not allowed to just multiply inequalities by -2 willy-nilly
2021-10-08 18:08:25	gas51627	right, so what you list now - are properties of the functions
2021-10-08 18:08:56	gas51627	and reflexivity, transitivity, etc - are properties of the objects
2021-10-08 18:09:04	gas51627	(or domain)
2021-10-08 18:09:28	Gurkenglas	Okay. Functions in general come defined with a set of things they can take in. When we restrict the function "times itself" to the non-negative real numbers, it is bijective
2021-10-08 18:09:52	gas51627	domain
2021-10-08 18:09:59	gas51627	that's it I think
2021-10-08 18:10:02	Gurkenglas	yes. x times x = y times y implies x = y, so long as we know that both x and y are non-negative
2021-10-08 18:10:46	gas51627	right
2021-10-08 18:10:51	Gurkenglas	a function being bijective can be equivalently described as that function having an inverse, another function such that applying one and then the other goes back where you started
2021-10-08 18:11:31	Gurkenglas	"times itself" with the domain being the positive numbers has an inverse, which we call sqrt
2021-10-08 18:12:05	Gurkenglas	(though whatever you were last reading about sqrt might notate things a little differently? :( )
2021-10-08 18:12:27	Gurkenglas	and in that case, sqrt(4) is in fact equal to sqrt(4)
2021-10-08 18:12:37	gas51627	i don't remember what I read about srqt to be honest

2021-10-08 18:14:23	Gurkenglas	that is, for every number that "times itself" might produce such as 4, we can talk about the preimage of 4: the set of what "times itself" will map to 4

2021-10-08 18:16:24	gas51627	right, so then the questions is how we define sqrt

2021-10-08 18:18:03	Gurkenglas	For any function, mapping an element of the codomain (the set of what might come out of the function) to its preimage is also a function, and of course it's well defined; {-2,2}={-2,2}. Of course this doesn't imply that any element on the left is equal to every element on the right :). It does mean that every element on the left is equal to *some* element on the right.

2021-10-08 18:19:48	Gurkenglas	In general when you see words like transitivity I recommend that you think of them in terms of what they allow you to do: That < is transitive *means* that given a<b and b<c you are allowed to deduce a<c
2021-10-08 18:20:24	gas51627	so transitivity is a property of an operator

2021-10-08 18:30:55	Gurkenglas	It allows you to discard parentheses, or perhaps even more satisfyingly:
2021-10-08 18:31:37	Gurkenglas	An operator being associative means that actually it doesn't really take two inputs, it takes any finite list of inputs

2021-10-08 18:32:02	Gurkenglas	That is, + being associative means you can add up a list of numbers and it's clear what that means.
2021-10-08 18:32:23	Gurkenglas	+ being associative means you can add up a finite *set* of numbers, even, and it's unique what that means
2021-10-08 18:32:24	gas51627	replace word list with set
2021-10-08 18:32:36	Gurkenglas	-associative+commutative ._.
2021-10-08 18:33:15	Gurkenglas	commutative is *defined* using a+b = b+a, but I'd say what it *means* is that + can take as input not just a finite list (ordered set), but any finite set.
2021-10-08 18:33:37	gas51627	well, parenthesis are basically indexes
2021-10-08 18:33:57	gas51627	so then associative means that you accept a set (unindexed)
2021-10-08 18:34:09	gas51627	and non-assiciativity means that set must be indexed
2021-10-08 18:34:23	Gurkenglas	oh shit, i misread what you said about associative
2021-10-08 18:34:29	Gurkenglas	i think you misread the definition
2021-10-08 18:34:43	Gurkenglas	+ being associative is usually defined as (a+b)+c=a+(b+c)
2021-10-08 18:34:59	gas51627	no no yes, that's what I meant
2021-10-08 18:35:07	Gurkenglas	ah ok
2021-10-08 18:35:23	Gurkenglas	so if you have associative, but not commutative, then you can add up a list, but not a set
2021-10-08 18:35:29	gas51627	or (a + b) + (c + d) = a + ( b + c) + d
2021-10-08 18:36:50	gas51627	sorry I am a bit confused
2021-10-08 18:36:58	gas51627	what's the differnece between associative and commutative
2021-10-08 18:37:05	gas51627	seems like the same thing to me
2021-10-08 18:38:56	←	WYfM2fGh has left ##math (Leaving ... Goodbye.)
2021-10-08 18:42:16	Gurkenglas	commutative means 1+2=2+1
2021-10-08 18:42:42	Gurkenglas	associative means 1+5+4+5+7+5 doesn't depend on where you insert ( and )
2021-10-08 18:42:52	dila	as a binary operator: a*b = f(a,b) is means the map is symmetric: f(a,b) = f(b,a)
2021-10-08 18:43:54	gas51627	yah
2021-10-08 18:44:06	→	Mare has joined ##math
2021-10-08 18:44:07	gas51627	but it seems that associativity and commutativity are pretty close together
2021-10-08 18:44:16	dila	yes, they are both field axioms
2021-10-08 18:44:30	Gurkenglas	For example, composition of recipes is associative but not commutative: (add salt, then stir), then cook is the same as add salt, then (stir, then cook), but not the same as cook, then (stir, then add salt)
2021-10-08 18:45:22	gas51627	I would say that associativity does not make any difference in this example
2021-10-08 18:45:25	gas51627	or sense

2021-10-08 18:45:39	gas51627	because there is no such thing as (stir, then cook)
2021-10-08 18:45:56	Gurkenglas	sure there is, you can stir and cook without adding salt
2021-10-08 18:46:38	Gurkenglas	You can send one assistant to add salt, then when he comes back another to stir and cook; or you might send one to add salt and stir, then another to cook
2021-10-08 18:46:43	cherim	It's the worst example of associativity I've ever seen. The records do not renew often in this case
2021-10-08 18:46:48	dila	matrix multiplication is an example of somethign that is non-commutative

2021-10-08 18:47:30	gas51627	even division is not commutative
2021-10-08 18:47:40	gas51627	5 / 7 is not = 7 / 5

2021-10-08 18:47:53	dila	yeh division is a better example i guess
2021-10-08 18:48:12	Gurkenglas	(12/6)/2 is not the same as 12/(6/2)
2021-10-08 18:48:31	gas51627	ok, so commutativity is about the direction
2021-10-08 18:48:42	Gurkenglas	About the order, yes
2021-10-08 18:48:51	gas51627	or whether going left to right is the same as going right to left
2021-10-08 18:48:59	X-Scale	gas51627: associativity can be a much more restrictive property than commutativity
2021-10-08 18:49:00	gas51627	and associativity is about the order
2021-10-08 18:49:17	gas51627	(while preserving direction)
2021-10-08 18:49:38	Gurkenglas	associativity is about whether we're allowed to flatten the binary tree into a list
2021-10-08 18:49:52	dila	subtraction is non-commutative too: a-b != b-a

2021-10-09 01:09:51	isekaijin	[itchyjunk]: The reason why countability matters in the definition is this. You want to measure the “sizes” of subsets. And one reasonable property for such “sizes” is that, if you split a measurable subset into at most countably many measurable subsets, then the “size” of the original set is the sum of the “sizes” of the subsets.
2021-10-09 01:10:16	isekaijin	On the other hand, if you split into uncountably many subsets, even measurable ones, then all bets are off.
2021-10-09 01:10:30	isekaijin	For example, the interval [0,1] has length 1, but each individual point in it has length 0.

2021-10-09 01:27:03	isekaijin	One intuition that works if you are physically-minded is that, if you take a “finitely sized” thing and split it into countably many parts, then some of those parts will also be “finitely sized”. But if you split it into uncountably many parts, then most of them will in some sense be “infinitesimally sized”.

2021-10-09 02:33:14	acegallagher	 "correlate"
2021-10-09 02:34:39	joel135	is the two-dimensional one meaningfully complex or do you just call it complex because it has two dimensions?

2021-10-09 02:37:58	acegallagher	joel135: I call it complex because the way I could make sense of this was thinking of complex numbers
2021-10-09 02:38:04	acegallagher	but in reality it's just two dimensional
2021-10-09 02:38:11	joel135	ok
2021-10-09 02:39:12	joel135	Cov(X,Y) makes sense for random vectors X and Y of different lengths
2021-10-09 02:39:54	joel135	but say you need to divide by "std(X)std(Y)"
2021-10-09 02:41:36	joel135	one thing you could do is take the rectangular matrix Cov(X,Y) and the square matrices Cov(X,X) and Cov(Y,Y), and then you take the matrix square roots of the latter two, and then you do matrix division on both sides: sqrt(Cov(X,X))\Cov(X,Y)/sqrt(Cov(Y,Y))

2021-10-14 13:10:16	PlanckWalk	The link you gave literally claims (2), but it's only because what it means by the term "sequence" is really "computable sequence".
2021-10-14 13:10:33	PlanckWalk	So if you didn't know that, you'd think that they actually meant (2).
2021-10-14 13:11:40	PlanckWalk	(And they should be slapped on the knuckles until they stop redefining common terms)

2021-10-14 13:14:17	twJizhan	so that Theorem 12 "A sequence converges to a limit if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy condition" should rigorously be rephrased as "A [computable] sequence converges to a limit if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy condition"
2021-10-14 13:17:45	twJizhan	also, so when I said:
2021-10-14 13:17:47	twJizhan	<twJizhan> every "Cauchy seq." in a/the *computable* number field: (1) is consisting of *computable* numbers (2) converges to a *computable* number...
2021-10-14 13:18:07	twJizhan	uh
2021-10-14 13:18:55	twJizhan	I should rigorously specify computable or uncomputable Cauchy seq.

2021-10-14 13:32:21	twJizhan	the motivation made me to google out that paper is the following question:
2021-10-14 13:32:29	twJizhan	is R as a ("normal"-)(Cauchy-)complete field the/a "smallest" ("normal"-)(Cauchy-)complete field containing (a copy of) field Q?
2021-10-14 13:32:30	twJizhan	where "normal" means: in terms of normal metric (and not things like p-adic metric)
2021-10-14 13:32:30	twJizhan	where "smallest" means: being a subfield contained in any ("normal"-)(Cauchy-)complete field

E.g., if "a" was 8, "b" was 4, "c" was 3 and "d" was 1, the formula should give the answer 6? Another example: if "a" was 14, "b" was 5, "c" was 4 and "d" was 2, the

2021-10-17 19:15:41	niedzejkob[m]	oh, the thing about shifting by a root candidate is that you already computed P(a) which is the constant term coefficient
2021-10-17 19:15:47	vancz	some of this still looks kind of funky to me
2021-10-17 19:16:01	vancz	wait why does shifting preserve the constant term?
2021-10-17 19:16:06	vancz	huh?
2021-10-17 19:16:20	vancz	also currently im hung up on:
2021-10-17 19:16:29	vancz	"Substituting x = 1 + t yields a polynomial in t with constant term P(1) = 1,"
2021-10-17 19:16:58	niedzejkob[m]	it doesn't, but substituting x := a + t will get you P'(t) = P(a + t), so P'(0) = P(a)
2021-10-17 19:17:05	niedzejkob[m]	a=1 in the example
2021-10-17 19:17:15	niedzejkob[m]	and P'(0) is the constant term of the new polynomial
2021-10-17 19:17:46	vancz	though, ok i guess this is what i was saying earlier about not needing to expand the substitution because the constant and highest degree terms are the only ones that matter, and those expand as if t^3 "+" 1^3
2021-10-17 19:17:52	vancz	i.e. its the same as if you calculated p(1)
2021-10-17 19:18:10	niedzejkob[m]	yup
2021-10-17 19:18:32	niedzejkob[m]	and you already calculate P(1) to check if it's zero

2021-10-17 19:20:05	vancz	(i have to figure out everything myself..)
2021-10-17 19:20:55	vancz	so, you apply the rational root theorem and start testing candidates, if you get a root youre happy, if you dont, you apply the rational root theorem on the old main coefficient and the "new" constant cofficient and take the intersection of the candidate sets, repeat
2021-10-17 19:21:14	niedzejkob[m]	yes
2021-10-17 19:21:18	vancz	and i think you might not even have to backtrack given that all roots should be preserved right?
2021-10-17 19:21:22	niedzejkob[m]	remember to shift the new candidates back
2021-10-17 19:21:31	Z-module	vancz, changing x to x + c in p(x) only preserves the constant term if the sum of all the non-constant-term coefficients of p(x) is 0. That sum is exactly p(1) - (the constant term), that is,  p(1) - p(0).

If you expand out all those terms, then all the new constant terms (with the still-present r_0 too) gives the constant term of p(x + c) which is   r_n c^n +...+ r_1 c + r_0.

Actually, I think it's a much too artificial example, because 4 possible candidate rational roots instead of 8 isn't worth the effort.

2021-10-17 19:52:13	niedzejkob[m]	what.
2021-10-17 19:52:37	vancz	" If you expand out all those terms, then all the new constant terms (with the still-present r_0 too) gives the constant term of p(x + c) which is   r_n c^n +...+ r_1 c + r_0."

2021-10-17 23:23:14	qergle	so do your infinite sum (1/2)^i from i=0 to ∞, and subtract sum (1/2)^i i=0 to 31
2021-10-17 23:23:40	cuppajoeman	Oh and then use the finite sum formula for i = 0 to 31?
2021-10-17 23:23:47	qergle	it's finite, so yes.
2021-10-17 23:24:43	qergle	or you can relabel your current sum, and do it all together
2021-10-17 23:25:46	cuppajoeman	I get it now
2021-10-17 23:25:57	cuppajoeman	thanks
2021-10-17 23:28:48	qergle	just focused on the sum z=31 to ∞ of 1/2^(z+1) now...
2021-10-17 23:29:36	qergle	let x=z-31, so you have sum x=0 to ∞ of (1/2)^32 * (1/2)^x = (1/2)^32 * sum x=0 to ∞ (1/2)^x
2021-10-17 23:29:37	→	johnkeats6 has joined ##math
2021-10-17 23:29:45	qergle	and you can do the latter as your infinite sum
2021-10-17 23:30:13	qergle	so you have as final answer: 2^30 * (1/2)^32 * sum x=0 to ∞ (1/2)^x

2021-10-26 20:44:26	greenbagels	i think u substitution might work; is there a trig identity you can use
2021-10-26 20:44:36	Guest7673	I tried u-sub, but got confused. Here is what i did
2021-10-26 20:45:22	Guest7673	u = sqrt(tan(x)) -> du = (1/2)(tan(x))^(-1/2)*sec^2(x)dx.  How do we handle this tan(x)^(-1/2) ?
2021-10-26 20:45:33	greenbagels	try this instead
2021-10-26 20:45:40	greenbagels	rewrite it with sec^2 = 1+tan^2
2021-10-26 20:45:56	greenbagels	you know d/dx tan(x) = sec^2(x)
2021-10-26 20:46:07	Guest7673	you mean just write u = tan(x)?
2021-10-26 20:46:11	greenbagels	yes
2021-10-26 20:46:19	Guest7673	ok, one second
2021-10-26 20:46:22	greenbagels	and then play with the sec^4 to make it subsitute-able
2021-10-26 20:46:29	greenbagels	because ify ou dont, you get a du^2 back and that doesn't work
2021-10-26 20:47:17	Guest7673	so we get integral u^(1/2) (1+u^2)du
2021-10-26 20:47:21	Guest7673	which is much easier
2021-10-26 20:47:42	Guest7673	I'm guessing we can also do it by integration by parts and get the same thing

2021-10-26 20:52:06	greenbagels	integration by parts and integration by u substitution are kind of dual entities to the product rule and chain rule, respectively

2021-10-27 16:39:18	acresearch	jmorris:      if you are rich, maybe yes, doubling 10,000,000 into 20,000,000 would have a significant effect on your life,    but if you are average person doubling 1000 to 2000 after waiting 1/4 or 1/2 your life is not significant    you get my point of view?
2021-10-27 16:39:29	jmorris	yeah and?
2021-10-27 16:39:43	jmorris	1000 dollars isn't a lot of money
2021-10-27 16:39:50	jmorris	you probably shouldnt be gambling it in the market
2021-10-27 16:40:10	acresearch	so the concept of investing to and re-investing your dividend for 20-30 years only works for rich people, not normal people
2021-10-27 16:40:12	W	"Indeed, if one calls the set a /can/ and the arcs /worms/, then posing a worm problem is truly opening a can of worms." sometimes the love of wordplay goes too far (Sectorial Covers for Unit Arcs by John E. Wetzel & Wacharin Wichiramala)
2021-10-27 16:40:28	jmorris	acresearch: most people have more than 1000 but
2021-10-27 16:40:29	jmorris	yeah
2021-10-27 16:40:49	greenbagels	W: lol
2021-10-27 16:40:55	jmorris	if you only have that much money you should focus on getting payed i guess
2021-10-27 16:41:12	acresearch	jmorris: which is not what many of the online videos are talking about,,, they claim that if you invest today you can live of dividend 20-30 years later
2021-10-27 16:41:29	acresearch	, if you invest some of your money and not even re-invest 100% of it
2021-10-27 16:41:37	W	acresearch, I would suggest not watching videos about getting rich
2021-10-27 16:41:43	jmorris	well to be fair
2021-10-27 16:41:45	acresearch	W: haha
2021-10-27 16:41:52	jmorris	you wouldn't just invest a lump sum and call it a day

2021-10-27 16:42:54	jmorris	it may be better than leaving it in your bank where its losing value

2021-10-27 18:02:05	[itchyjunk]	I tried to turn this into a quadratic and use the formula to find the roots but it didn't work out well. not sure what else to try :: https://i.imgur.com/sqSOdYH.png
2021-10-27 18:02:23	[itchyjunk]	I still think quadratic is the way to go, but just turned into a mess
2021-10-27 18:03:19	Sofia	greenbagels: The goal is to balance the splits such that the area can be recursively subdivided. This is towards subdivision approaches for rendering arbitrary closed-form implicit surfaces. In this case to render a 2D ellipse, or more generally an N-dimensional ellipsoid.
2021-10-27 18:03:27	PlanckWalk	sin(x + iy) = sin(x) cosh(y) + i cos(x) sinh(y)  or something.
2021-10-27 18:04:32	PlanckWalk	I'm not sure where a quadratic comes into that.
2021-10-27 18:04:34	Sofia	To be more specific; I'm enumerating a few ideas towards subdivision and I have a strategy I believe to be optimal for ellipses and I want to score it, in terms of area removed per operation.
2021-10-27 18:05:22	Sofia	I don't need this optimal method to be useful in practice; I only want it to show what optimal splits would be.
2021-10-27 18:05:23	PlanckWalk	sin(x) cosh(y) + i cos(x) sinh(y) = cosh(4)  implies  sin(x) cosh(y) = cosh(4)  and cos(x) sinh(y) = 0

Very similar thing for the series for sin and sinh, but sinh(iz) ends up being i times the series for sin, since i^1 = i, i^3 = -i, i^5 = i, i^7 = -i,

I'm in CS program but I setup my program to take the following electives (Linear algebra 1-3, linear programming, abstract algebra, number theory, graph theory, combinatorics, ring theory and modules). I have taken some logic courses and now first course in proofs, calc 1 and calc 2. will I have a hard time if I did not take calc 3 and

2021-10-27 19:10:53	quantum	[itchyjunk]: In general, an algebra is a vector space equipped with some kind of product
2021-10-27 19:10:56	johnkeats6	quantum, it has to be if the product is bilinear
2021-10-27 19:11:00	[itchyjunk]	says if the vector mult is tensor product then it's tensor algebra
2021-10-27 19:11:14	johnkeats6	every bilinear thing factors through the tensor product
2021-10-27 19:12:07	quantum	ok yeah
2021-10-27 19:12:20	quantum	I can see how that'd be shown

2021-10-27 19:13:18	[itchyjunk]	but apparently one of the choices is correct and not the other?
2021-10-27 19:13:45	riv	so we have
2021-10-27 19:13:48	riv	sin(z) = [e^(iz) - e^(-iz)] / 2i

2021-10-27 19:13:51	[itchyjunk]	sinh(y) = 0 or cosh(y) = cosh(4)

2021-10-27 19:32:38	johnkeats6	well when you put it that way

2021-10-27 19:34:44	johnkeats6	don't you need a unit to map the ground field/ring
2021-10-27 19:35:25	quantum	I don't think so
2021-10-27 19:35:59	quantum	this construction is all done over the same field, so I think it's implicit

2021-10-27 20:18:12	Z-module	VEry easy fact: The vector space F of *all* (including discontinuous) functions R -> R has the direct sum splitting:  F = W (+) V  where W is all the even functions, V all the odd functions.
2021-10-27 20:18:22	[-_-]	greenbagels: okay...so P_n(x) = sum a_j x^(s+j)

2021-10-29 18:41:22	Cale	I'm thinking along the lines of prime ideal <-> irreducible variety, and this translation operation corresponds to translation of the variety along the y axis

2021-10-29 18:44:21	savask	I was thinking that by using translation you can reduce the degree of polynomials in your ideal, say, if f is in the ideal then f(y+a) - f(y) is also in it and has lower degree

2021-10-29 18:56:22	Cale	Of course, you'll get an algebraic closure which is often going to be garbage instead of a nice projection. Like, if you started with a sphere in R^(2+1), your projection to R^2 is going to be a filled disc, and then its algebraic closure is just the whole plane, I think. It's been 15 years since I did any algebraic geometry, I should do some algebraic geometry.

2021-10-29 19:00:54	isekaijin	Radicand, I think.
2021-10-29 19:00:56	JimmyRustles	thanks
2021-10-29 19:02:06	isekaijin	savask: No, I think that ideal is too large. For example, if p is the ideal of an arbitrary hypersurface, then it most likely projects onto the whole of A^n, or at least a dense subset of it. So we should obtain the zero ideal.
2021-10-29 19:02:10	Z-module	yes, radicand = the thing whose (square) root is being taken
2021-10-29 19:02:57	[itchyjunk]	didn't know that had a word
2021-10-29 19:03:12	Cale	savask: I was thinking you could use that degree-reducing operation you mentioned before, repeatedly, until y is eliminated, and that gets you some polynomial in x_1,...,x_n

2021-10-29 19:04:54	[itchyjunk]	probably easy for you anyways
2021-10-29 19:04:56	savask	Cale: Well, that was the idea. Say, if polynomial cy + d is in p and our new (larger) ideal is q, then c(y+a)+d - (cy+d) = ca is in q, so c is. Since q is an ideal, cy is there also, and so d lies there. It seems that it works for higher degrees as well (if char k = 0), and that way you can put all coefficients inside of q
2021-10-29 19:06:03	isekaijin	[itchyjunk]: I could only wish they were easy. The only way to do things that are difficult is to start doing them. Waiting until they become easy means waiting forever.

2021-10-29 19:08:00	isekaijin	Okay, since the arbitrary prime ideal case is too difficult, let's just consider the homogeneous ideal case. Then the translations are no longer of the form f(y-a), but rather f(y - a1 x1 - ... - an xn), for some constants a1, ..., an.

2021-10-29 22:29:14	azonenberg	So I'm trying to wrap my head around least squares fits
2021-10-29 22:30:00	azonenberg	I have a dataset consisting of two noisy sinewaves of approximately known, equal frequency
2021-10-29 22:30:04	azonenberg	but different amplitude and phase
2021-10-29 22:30:35	azonenberg	My goal is to determine the amplitude and phase of the second sinewave with respect to the first
2021-10-29 22:30:59	azonenberg	My initial idea was to take a fourier transform of both then find the highest bin in the output and compute the ratio of amplitudes / different in phases
2021-10-29 22:31:10	azonenberg	Which worked but is giving very noisy phase data for some reason
2021-10-29 22:31:38	azonenberg	also it seems inefficient because I only care about one frequency
2021-10-29 22:32:30	azonenberg	So my thought is, if I could fit a pure sine (amplitude, starting phase, frequency to each waveform I could probably get more robust results in the presence of noise
2021-10-29 22:33:10	Koen	amplitude shouldn't be too hard to fit
2021-10-29 22:33:12	azonenberg	The system is extremely overdetermined, the datasets contain a huge number of samples - anywhere from a few hundred thousand to tens of millions of points, sampled significantly faster than Nyquist
2021-10-29 22:33:15	Koen	it's basically max-min
2021-10-29 22:33:19	azonenberg	amplitude is easy, phase is the hard part
2021-10-29 22:33:32	azonenberg	I have a good starting guess of frequency since I generated the input waveform
2021-10-29 22:33:42	azonenberg	but the local oscillators of the generator and detector are not necessarily coherent
2021-10-29 22:33:46	azonenberg	so there is likely a small amount of drift
2021-10-29 22:34:01	azonenberg	probably in the <10 ppm range
2021-10-29 22:34:10	azonenberg	but enough to be substantial over a long record

2021-10-29 22:35:16	azonenberg	Context: I'm trying to measure the vector response of a circuit in the forward direction
2021-10-29 22:35:27	azonenberg	So I take a sinewave generator and feed it through a splitter
2021-10-29 22:35:30	Koen	phase shouldn't be too hard either; it doesn't matter that it's actually a sine, only that it's periodic. for instance, keep only the points at the top of each wave and discard all the rest; that's enough to find the phase
2021-10-29 22:35:30	→	jwpapi_ has joined ##math
2021-10-29 22:35:32	azonenberg	one leg of the splitter goes into an oscilloscope

2021-10-29 22:36:12	azonenberg	I'm past Nyquist but not by much
2021-10-29 22:36:25	azonenberg	Input frequency ranges from near DC to 16 GHz

2021-10-29 22:37:26	Koen	how many periods do you have in yoru sample?

2021-10-29 22:38:10	→	Ekho- has joined ##math
2021-10-29 22:38:17	azonenberg	Depends on the input frequency. At low freq not as many but at higher freq... let's say 20M points at 2.5 samples per cycle so... about 8 million cycles
2021-10-29 22:38:44	azonenberg	that's for 16 GHz input, but input could go down to a few MHz in which case i might only have a few cycles - that's easy mode though because a huge time error is a tiny phase error
2021-10-29 22:38:54	azonenberg	you can just interpolate zero crossings and find relative differences or something
2021-10-29 22:39:06	azonenberg	But yeah, on the high speed is where it gets trickier
2021-10-29 22:39:17	azonenberg	I'm sampling faster than Nyquist, but not by a lot
2021-10-29 22:40:02	azonenberg	So the question is how to find the phase of such a signal accurately
2021-10-29 22:40:32	azonenberg	even amplitude is nontrivial because the data also has noise on it, and most of the cycles of the waveform will not be at a peak
2021-10-29 22:40:37	azonenberg	most of the samples*
2021-10-29 22:40:46	azonenberg	This really feels like a curve fitting problem to me

2021-10-29 22:45:11	W	azonenberg, how approximate is your knowledge of the frequencies? Can you just do a Slow Fourier Transform for the one (or two) frequencies?
2021-10-29 22:45:25	W	i.e. just do the full sum over the data
2021-10-29 22:45:52	azonenberg	w: I know what I told the generator to output
2021-10-29 22:46:02	W	something I've been playing with for a similar problem is to average the change in phase per unit time to hone in on the frequency I want
2021-10-29 22:46:28	azonenberg	So basically it's down to the drift between the local oscillator on the scope and the generator
2021-10-29 22:46:32	W	i.e. do a good guess for the frequency, if it's close the phase over time will rotate "towards" the correct frequency
2021-10-29 22:46:56	azonenberg	I can also get a good guess of the corrected frequency by counting zero crossings in the waveform
2021-10-29 22:47:00	azonenberg	and dividing by record length
2021-10-29 22:47:42	azonenberg	Once i know frequency and phase, i can get relative amplitude easily by convolving each waveform with a unit-amplitude sine fit to it
2021-10-29 22:47:50	azonenberg	and dividing one by the other
2021-10-29 22:48:14	azonenberg	and frequency can be got very close by counting zero crossings like i said
2021-10-29 22:48:35	azonenberg	So really it's a question of how to find the phase accurately given the relatively undersampled data
2021-10-29 22:49:29	azonenberg	https://www.antikernel.net/temp/12ghz.png
2021-10-29 22:49:49	W	over such a large data set, a simple sum should be good, I would think
2021-10-29 22:49:56	azonenberg	here's an example of some real data. this is zoomed way in, the actual dataset is 80,000 points
2021-10-29 22:50:02	azonenberg	and that's relatively small, i can go out to tens of millions easily

2021-10-29 22:50:58	azonenberg	You can see in the FFT output that there are some subharmonics and noise present as well
2021-10-29 22:51:23	azonenberg	this particular 12 GHz tone was generated by a frequency doubler from a 6 GHz input and some of the 6 GHz leaks through. so basically this means even and odd numbered cycles of the sine have slightly different amplitude

2021-10-29 23:12:28	bildramer	assume there's a timescale for which it's ~constant, create overlapping windows that long, FFT in each window, then use pure frequency data to determine phase drift (higher/lower frequency = earlier/later), something like that? but the noise could ruin that

2021-10-29 23:15:17	azonenberg	There's not phase drift AFAIK
2021-10-29 23:15:22	azonenberg	shouldnt be within the waveform
2021-10-29 23:15:43	azonenberg	there is however likely to be a (mostly constant) frequency shift from the generator to the receiver
2021-10-29 23:15:56	azonenberg	i.e. i tell the generator to output 6.000 GHz and I actually get 6.00001 GHz
2021-10-29 23:16:03	azonenberg	relative to the timebase of the oscilloscope
2021-10-29 23:16:12	azonenberg	since they're not coherent oscillators
2021-10-29 23:16:40	azonenberg	So while I know the nominal frequency of the input signal, calibration errors on both the scope and generator mean the scope will not see exactly the frequency I told the generator to produce
2021-10-29 23:16:53	azonenberg	so i do need to do some fitting to recover the exact frequency WRT the sample clock
2021-10-29 23:17:01	bildramer	is "multiply pure sine and signal" cheap enough that you can do it 20ish times?
2021-10-29 23:18:21	azonenberg	Yeah it should be. I can AVX512 it or push to the GPU if it's too slow
2021-10-29 23:18:30	azonenberg	You thinking an iterative method of some sort?
2021-10-29 23:18:46	bildramer	yeah
2021-10-29 23:21:03	bildramer	I can't really predict if this will work well
2021-10-29 23:21:32	bildramer	how about: have a good starting guess interval, use two orthogonal sines to determine ampilitude and phase simultaneously, do binary search to find the frequency
2021-10-29 23:23:21	→	Macuser has joined ##math
2021-10-29 23:24:07	bildramer	dunno if it's best to assume one signal is correct and the other a deviation from that, or take an average of the frequencies, or something - but intuitively I don't see an obvious failure mode
2021-10-29 23:25:39	bildramer	or even use two different frequencies but pretend they're equal and the raw phase difference makes sense

2021-10-29 23:30:04	W	I guess what I was describing earlier was beating, as in, the phase will rotate with a frequency of |frequency guessed-actual frequency|/2, which if you can detect the beat phase, gives you how far away you were from the real frequency
2021-10-29 23:33:40	W	(and I guess, more usefully, gives you the real phase outright?)

I've also show that is  pseudo polynomial. Now i want to show that it is not strongly np complete, How can I do so ?

2021-11-01 17:40:15	Decker	I'd figure the case is you end up with fractional parts that make ou keep more digits than you would otherwise keep because of a /prime operation

2021-11-01 18:35:23	cloudcell	Hello! I have a question related to the set theory. The question is why does the following problem talks about R^2 x R^2 ? why is V a cartesian product of two sets of coordinates instead of simply a union?
2021-11-01 18:35:27	cloudcell	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/CkLR6k5c/image.png
2021-11-01 18:36:19	riv	V = U^2 u L^2
2021-11-01 18:36:21	cloudcell	in short, I cannot understand what the statement " R^2 x R^2 " means... :(
2021-11-01 18:36:49	riv	U is a subset of R^2, the upper half plane
2021-11-01 18:36:57	riv	L is the bottom half plane
2021-11-01 18:36:57	cloudcell	yes
2021-11-01 18:37:00	cloudcell	yes
2021-11-01 18:37:03	riv	so U u L = R^2, the whole plane
2021-11-01 18:37:10	cloudcell	that's understandable
2021-11-01 18:37:17	cloudcell	but the  R^2 x R^2  is not
2021-11-01 18:37:43	riv	I think that we can rewrite  U^2 u L^2 = (U u L)^2
2021-11-01 18:37:59	riv	if that is valid, then it makes sense that U^2 u L^2 = (R^2)^2
2021-11-01 18:38:18	cloudcell	hmmm
2021-11-01 18:38:24	riv	(R^2)^2 = R^2 x R^2 = R^4 -- these are all 4d space
2021-11-01 18:38:35	riv	aj
2021-11-01 18:38:37	cloudcell	yes, that's what is puzzling
2021-11-01 18:38:37	riv	ah
2021-11-01 18:38:41	riv	so what I have said is not valid
2021-11-01 18:38:48	riv	U^2 u L^2 = (U u L)^2   we can't do this
2021-11-01 18:38:57	riv	because of part (d)

2021-11-01 18:39:36	cloudcell	V is a subset of a 4D space, right?
2021-11-01 18:39:39	riv	we need to think about this as a subset of 4D space
2021-11-01 18:39:42	riv	yes
2021-11-01 18:39:47	cloudcell	haha, thanks :)
2021-11-01 18:39:59	riv	U^2 is the upper half plane squared, so it's like a 4d space that is above the x axis in both ways
2021-11-01 18:40:01	cloudcell	yeah, now that makes sense
2021-11-01 18:40:03	riv	V^2 is similar but below
2021-11-01 18:40:14	riv	but the union is not all of R^4
2021-11-01 18:40:36	riv	its missing bits that are above in the first two coordinates but below in the second two coordinates
2021-11-01 18:40:38	Guest59	how do I solve -u''(x) + 20u'(x) = x^2, 0<x<1, u(0)=0, u(1)=0 ?

2021-11-01 18:56:37	Guest59	wut
2021-11-01 18:56:43	greenbagels	since the square term could cancel with the linear term via u'', right
2021-11-01 18:56:48	quantum	the `cx + d` vanishes under the `d2/dx2`
2021-11-01 18:56:59	Z-module	cloudcell: to be quite explicit in terms of ordered pairs: V = U^2 u L^2 = (U x U) u (L x L), so something in V has the form  ((x,y), (x',y')) where either: both (x,y) and (x',y') are in U   meaning that y, y' are both >= 0,  or:  both (x,y) and (x',y') are in L  meaning y, y' both < 0. But in either case, (x,y) and (x',y') are both in R x R = R^2, so this thing in V is also in R^2 x R^2
2021-11-01 18:57:06	quantum	greenbagels: no you're right
2021-11-01 18:57:24	quantum	it won't have a constant term, because that's the only thing that vanishes under both

2021-11-01 19:07:28	Z-module	savask, I found a neat paper from 1990 with this result, but I'm not sure if it's surprising much, or not.  Let G = S_N = the group of all permutations of a countably infinite set, considered as a group action on N, and thus also as a group action on Pow(N). Obviously two sets A, B in Pow(N) are in the same G-orbit iff |A| = |B| and |A^c| = |B^c|  where ^c denotes complement in N. Call such pairs A,B "good subset pairs". So G is
2021-11-01 19:07:28	Z-module	"transitive on good subset pairs". The result is that this G has a proper subgroup, still acting on all of Pow(N), that's also transtive on good subset pairs.

2021-11-01 19:43:35	int-e	amosbird: as for intuition... it's probably best to start with something simple like (1+x)^n; the coefficient of x^k arises from all the ways to pick the 'x' term k times from the n factors (and picking 1 for all the other factors)

2021-11-01 19:55:31	greenbagels	JimmyRustles: tl;dr: to try to make this graph in the general case, its going to take some vector geometry
2021-11-01 19:55:58	bildramer	tl;dr it will work like this, but it's better to try to understand why: say your line is y = 2x + 3. the slope is 2. then pick a vector u=(2,1) and one orthogonal to it, v=(1,-2), then plot the points p where p = (0,3) + u*t + v*sin(t), varying t
2021-11-01 19:56:03	→	XCode has joined ##math
2021-11-01 19:56:53	bildramer	maybe it's better to normalize u and v (divide by their length, here sqrt(5)). maybe that's not the most convenient parametric form, and so on
2021-11-01 19:57:31	bildramer	also if you rotate it, even if it's a function, it will be ugly

2021-11-01 20:07:23	JimmyRustles	that's exactly what i need
2021-11-01 20:08:02	bildramer	I'd say you first should also divide (2,1) to get (2/sqrt(5),1/sqrt(5)) so that when t=1 you've moved a length of exactly 1
2021-11-01 20:08:03	JimmyRustles	so more generally, it'd be (x,y) = (0, c) + (m, 1)*t + (1, -m)*sin(t)?

2021-11-01 20:09:01	bildramer	maybe also replace m with an angle, so there are less numerical problems and you can go straight up, so (cos(a),sin(a))*t + (sin(a),-cos(a))*sin(t)

2021-11-01 20:10:12	bildramer	dividing by the length of the (2,1) vector (which is sqrt(5)), or in general (m,1) then sqrt(m^2+1), fixes that

I want to show that Y' is continuously embedded into X', where the duals are equipped with the weak dual topology. So far, I'm planning on constructing a continuous embedding from a dense subset of Y' taken somehow from the range of the
2021-11-01 20:23:31	harwiltz	embedding X->Y, and then extending it to Y' with the Hahn-Banach theorem. However I'm not sure how to get any correspondence between the primal and dual spaces...
2021-11-01 20:24:44	harwiltz	Also I know that since X,Y are locally convex, so are X' and Y' (with the weak dual topology)

2021-11-01 20:45:07	Decker	maybe they are; maybe I'm just confusing myself with the definition I think it is vs wht it really is
2021-11-01 20:45:55	Decker	antipodal is typically considered the 1pi sphere from the origin - where all rotations are 180 from the origin?  Although they can relate with oppositing antipodal points that are the same point

2021-11-02 00:22:01	isekaijin	loller_: Notice that you actually only need to cover the line with squares whose total area adds up to less than 1. To get a cover whose area adds up to less than an arbitrary e > 0, just rescale the whole plane. (This rescales and translates the squares.)

2021-11-02 00:35:43	isekaijin	loller_: The total area of the squares cannot possibly be zero.
2021-11-02 00:36:14	isekaijin	loller_: Also, I think the squares are not correctly placed.
2021-11-02 00:38:08	isekaijin	Rather than giving a closed formula for the placement of each square, I think you are better off giving an algorithm for placing the squares.
2021-11-02 00:38:56	isekaijin	loller_: Anyhow, here is an idea. First consider the square [k, k+1]^2 for k \in Z. Obviously, these squares are “too large”, right?
2021-11-02 00:39:03	→	anovick has joined ##math
2021-11-02 00:39:11	isekaijin	Since each of these squares has area 1. The total area is infinite. Too large!
2021-11-02 00:40:22	isekaijin	Errr, wait. Let me work out the details. Please wait.
2021-11-02 00:41:08	loller_	yeah I see how the solution has to be modified
2021-11-02 00:41:31	isekaijin	Okay, now I see it. Actually, it is easier if we first work with the first quadrant only.
2021-11-02 00:41:39	loller_	when I state the squares as [k/2^n, (k+1)/2^n]^2, they end up not being placed along the line y=x, right?
2021-11-02 00:41:42	isekaijin	So y = x, but only for x, y >= 0.

2021-11-12 18:29:16	lpapp	W: is the expected not 12 instead of 11 in your test case?
2021-11-12 18:30:30	W	yes, sorry
2021-11-12 18:30:37	lpapp	so, there is another bug somewhere
2021-11-12 18:30:41	←	unmanbearpig has quit (Ping timeout: 256 seconds)
2021-11-12 18:30:45	W	I didn't actually make a program to do it right or anything, just manually counted, and I counted wrong
2021-11-12 18:30:47	lpapp	but I can probably fix that, hopefully, fingers crossed.
2021-11-12 18:30:55	lpapp	I needed a test case to provide the code wrong.
2021-11-12 18:30:57	W	yeah, you can't advance back more than one
2021-11-12 18:31:14	lpapp	why not?
2021-11-12 18:31:17	W	(or until it's not matching front any more, at least
2021-11-12 18:31:49	W	because a new unique slice might start right after the duplicated entry
2021-11-12 18:31:53	lpapp	This gives 11: if (A[back] == A[front]) { back = front - 1; if (A[front] != A[back]) ++distinct_slices; }
2021-11-12 18:32:01	riv	can you generate test cases with known answers? i would maybe try that if i could not find the error
2021-11-12 18:32:26	→	unmanbearpig has joined ##math
2021-11-12 18:32:33	W	you can just write a brute force one for small examples and compare - e.g. iterate over all subsequences
2021-11-12 18:32:37	riv	or write a slower version which is more obviously correct, no optimizations, to compare against
2021-11-12 18:32:45	lpapp	W: I count everything until the duplicate with the other else ifs
2021-11-12 18:33:01	W	lpapp, no, not if there are bigger slices that continue
2021-11-12 18:33:01	lpapp	W: that is why I thought back can be advanced more than one, since all those jumped over were counted before.
2021-11-12 18:33:07	→	Koen_ has joined ##math
2021-11-12 18:33:31	W	lpapp, e.g. 0,1,2,3,4,1,6,7,8 - once you reach 1, everything after the first 1 is still a part of a unique slice until the end of the array
2021-11-12 18:33:42	lpapp	true
2021-11-12 18:33:46	W	you've only counted the ones that include the second 1, not beyond
2021-11-12 18:33:49	lpapp	so, my algo is not great.
2021-11-12 18:33:53	lpapp	maybe a throwaway and find a better.
2021-11-12 18:34:36	W	nah the framework is fine (and seems to be hinted at by the name of the task)
2021-11-12 18:34:37	riv	to solve this problem I would consider breaking the array up based on when the same thing occurs twice in a row
2021-11-12 18:34:46	riv	(may end up not being needed)
2021-11-12 18:35:22	W	I'd just advance front and back by 1 when a duplicate is found
2021-11-12 18:35:30	←	Koen has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2021-11-12 18:35:36	riv	in the example the CountDistinctSlices(A) = CountDistinctSlices(A[0..2]) + CountDistinctSlices(A[3..4])
2021-11-12 18:35:58	riv	yes good idea use array indices rather than copy the array

2021-11-12 18:36:30	riv	this approach doesn't help at all if the duplicates are apart from each other though
2021-11-12 18:36:53	lpapp	W: I will think about it after work, but I think then the counter increase would also need to be reconsidered.
2021-11-12 18:37:13	lpapp	that is why I am saying my algo is probably bin
2021-11-12 18:37:24	lpapp	the current advancement is tight to how I update the counter
2021-11-12 18:37:26	riv	I would probably build a secondary array B that returns the index of the next occurence of the element, i.e A[B[i]] = A[i] (or -1 if it never occurs again)
2021-11-12 18:37:44	lpapp	riv: I am trying to solve this with O(1) space complexity if possible.
2021-11-12 18:37:51	riv	do you mean O(N)?
2021-11-12 18:37:56	riv	oh sorry space, not time
2021-11-12 18:37:58	riv	I see
2021-11-12 18:38:01	lpapp	I was hoping that the caterpillar method would help me with that.
2021-11-12 18:38:04	W	"constant additional space" as they call it
2021-11-12 18:38:09	lpapp	yes, runtime is O(n) for sure
2021-11-12 18:38:12	riv	caterpillar method is new to me
2021-11-12 18:38:29	riv	I should do this codility stuff, it seems like it could teach me a lot
2021-11-12 18:38:38	riv	is it free to sign up
2021-11-12 18:39:26	lpapp	W: is this also a bad idea then? else if (A[front] == A[front + 1]) { distinct_slices += (front - back); back = front; }
2021-11-12 18:39:31	riv	https://codility.com/media/train/13-CaterpillarMethod.pdf ah so it is like O(n^2) search through the array, but it includes shortcutting to speed it up
2021-11-12 18:39:35	lpapp	here, I am also advancing more than just one step at a time
2021-11-12 18:39:53	riv	O(n^2) is acceptable to aim for right?
2021-11-12 18:40:06	lpapp	O(n^2) is slow on large datasets
2021-11-12 18:40:09	riv	ok

2021-11-12 18:40:41	riv	i suppose you do not need to actually iterate all O(n^2) options, you know they are all valid when your caterpillar contains distinct values
2021-11-12 18:40:44	tolarz	it's misleading to say this, lpapp
2021-11-12 18:40:45	→	drogas has joined ##math
2021-11-12 18:40:49	lpapp	I think most of the assignments are about to avoid O(n^2) or sometimes worse.
2021-11-12 18:41:06	tolarz	in practice, there's much more to efficiency than mere time complexity

2021-11-12 20:14:53	[itchyjunk]	What is a nice short definition of a ring i can throw in a paper? Let R be a set equipped with two binary operations +:RxR->R and *:RxR->R such that (R,+) is an abelian ring satisfying following axioms
2021-11-12 20:15:11	[itchyjunk]	And i mention the distributive law,associativity of * ?
2021-11-12 20:15:15	isekaijin	(R,+) is an Abelian group
2021-11-12 20:15:25	[itchyjunk]	oops Abelian group right
2021-11-12 20:15:43	isekaijin	It boils down to three requirements.
2021-11-12 20:15:49	isekaijin	The first one I said above.
2021-11-12 20:16:03	isekaijin	The second one is that (R,*) is a monoid. (Commutative monoid if you want the ring to be commutative.)
2021-11-12 20:16:26	[itchyjunk]	dont need commutivity
2021-11-12 20:16:36	[itchyjunk]	wgat dies monoid mean?
2021-11-12 20:16:40	[itchyjunk]	damnit
2021-11-12 20:16:40	isekaijin	The third one is that, if you fix one of the arguments of * (remember that * is a binary operation), then you get an endomorphism of the Abelian group (R,+).
2021-11-12 20:16:43	[itchyjunk]	What does monoid mean?
2021-11-12 20:17:03	isekaijin	A set with an associative binary operation that has an identity element.
2021-11-12 20:17:39	isekaijin	For example, the set of strings with concatenation as the binary operation.
2021-11-12 20:18:09	[itchyjunk]	oh okay, i don't require the 1 too much either. i just need to be able to define noetherian rings after and noetherian rings seem to work will all the def's of ring
2021-11-12 20:18:14	[itchyjunk]	non commutative, rng things
2021-11-12 20:18:35	riv	I would just define a ring using a list of axioms
2021-11-12 20:18:39	isekaijin	If you want rngs (r*i*ngs without *i*dentity), then you just need (R,*) to be a semigroup.
2021-11-12 20:18:48	riv	it is not short but it is honest
2021-11-12 20:19:03	isekaijin	I just say “a monoid in Ab” or “a semigroup in Ab”. All the hassle is shuffled to the reader of the definition.
2021-11-12 20:19:06	[itchyjunk]	hmm the list of axiom way of defining on wikipedia seemed longer hence was trying to compress it :P
2021-11-12 20:19:21	riv	dont compress it, just use up a page

2021-11-12 23:12:50	Simplar	Decker: so it's not depending on p?
2021-11-12 23:13:05	Decker	well you divide by P
2021-11-12 23:13:15	Decker	because you get more chances so it's easier to get

2021-11-12 23:16:12	Simplar	but getting tails at least 2 times when p = 2 is 1/4
2021-11-12 23:16:16	Simplar	because we have 4 outcomes

2021-11-21 01:23:23	cherim	If the probability to ever reach 0 starting from 1 P, then the probability of ever reaching 0 starting from 2 is P^2, as you can decompose such histories as "walk till you first reach 1 from 2" and "walk till you then reach 0 from 1"

2021-11-23 23:47:33	mathe8787	I got an e-mail from a letter of rec and he sent me his letter for me to review and he will make the final decision of the changes (he did that just in case he forgot something). I am curious of anyone’s thoughts here about the letter. Would you add or remove something?
2021-11-23 23:47:33	mathe8787	To the Members of the Graduate Admissions Committee,
2021-11-23 23:47:33	mathe8787	I am writing in support of XXX and his desire to attend your PhD program. X has taken my two courses, X and Y, and earned perfect grades, presented a seminal paper in my XX Seminar at the XX, and I am his internal evaluator for his master’s thesis.
2021-11-23 23:47:35	mathe8787	X has shown very strong interest in the field of XXX. He has stellar grades in this specialization and has also dedicated his time in obtaining experimental skills which are vital to the success of a PhD student. He has shown to be very proactive as he has reached out to many researchers in this field and he is currently doing his master’s thesis in X that focuses on this specialization.
2021-11-23 23:47:40	mathe8787	It is rare in XXX(country) for students to have as much research experience as X has had during his bachelors and masters. His ability to simultaneously fulfill coursework obligations and work as a research assistant is quite impressive. He will come well prepared into your PhD program as he carries the specialized knowledge in XX and the experimental experience. I firmly believe that X is going to be a very capable and qualified PhD
2021-11-23 23:47:45	mathe8787	candidate and the lab that chooses him will substantially profit from his arsenal of technical skills.
2021-11-23 23:47:47	mathe8787	I thus recommend X without reservation for the admission into your graduate program. I am sure you will find X to be a highly motivated, competent and committed student who will grow into a successful professional in this field. Please feel free to contact me if you require further information.

2021-11-23 23:54:54	mathe8787	really good points. I agree with "perfect" grades. Changed it.
2021-11-23 23:55:02	mathe8787	And yes I will try to quantify the experience.

What I want to be able to find out is after how long (years) will one overtake the other. This is not taking into account another set of  j,k variables, where as x grows by 67%, j which is directly related to x grows by  33% and k grows by 16% . -> http://mathb.in/67789

2021-11-24 16:51:47	bildramer	you have a line from a to b and one from c to d
2021-11-24 16:52:04	bildramer	if c < b, then they overlap between c and b, otherwise not at all
2021-11-24 16:52:35	bildramer	(as long as you've sorted them)
2021-11-24 16:53:21	bildramer	actually, it could also be the case that d<b, then it ends at d instead

2021-11-24 16:55:05	bildramer	so, the function looks like this: step 1. if a > c, rename ab to cd and vice versa. step 2. check if c<b. if yes, lower bound is c. if not, there's no intersection. step 3. check if d<b. if yes, upper bound is d. if not, it's b.

2021-11-24 17:03:34	parazyd	Anyone with experience in sagemath here? I have an elliptic curve y^2=x^3+3 over a finite field F_101. With generator G_1=(1,2) I have a subgroup of order 17. Then I have an extension field F_101^2 (which I make with F.extension(2) in sage).
2021-11-24 17:03:54	cadmio	if a subgroup of a group G has order n does it mean that G contains an element of order n?
2021-11-24 17:04:55	parazyd	The extension field can be generated from F_101 by adjoining a solution to a degree-2 polynomial that is not found in F_101.
2021-11-24 17:05:07	parazyd	x^2 + 2 is irreducible in F_101 and can be used.
2021-11-24 17:05:54	parazyd	So my question is, how can I have some "u" be one of the solutions to x^2 + 2, so that every element of F_101^2 can be written as a+b*u where a and b are from F_101?
2021-11-24 17:06:34	parazyd	And then to have some point which is there, like (36, 31u)

2021-11-24 17:29:41	andrew	Does anyone know any good, free, online complex analysis books? I plan on self-studying the subject with a friend of mine over the winter break, but we're both broke college students who can't afford anything expensive.
2021-11-24 17:32:37	taeaad	How accessible should the skill level be? I avoided complex analysis by focusing on real analysis and for me it was a good move. If you are good at calculus then you can do it without the more general topology that comes out of real analysis.
2021-11-24 17:33:16	taeaad	Complex analysis at the surface is advanced calculus; at the core it's about rotations and angle preserving functions.
2021-11-24 17:34:15	andrew	Fairly accessible, I think. I've done more advanced courses than my friend has; I'm in intro real analysis (i.e. calculus with rigor) and she's in linear algebra this semester, if you want an idea of our relative standings.
2021-11-24 17:37:05	cadmio	Z-module: yesterday you told me that: "Each 3-Sylow having order 3 means it *must* be of the for <(a b c)> since a single 3-cycle is the only type of element of order 3 in S_4" doesn't this imply what I asked before?
2021-11-24 17:37:16	taeaad	Maybe someone else can recommend standard texts. My approach is to study the abstract algebra that in some sense leads to complex analysis.

2021-11-24 17:46:11	Z-module	Any group, in this case your H, of prime order p must be cyclic.  H being cyclic  means H = <h>  for some h in H, so h itself has order p.
2021-11-24 17:47:00	Z-module	It's imply that each element of H has order that divides |H| = p, so the order has to be 1 or p.  Only e has order 1.

2021-11-24 19:44:17	[itchyjunk]	bit title @_@
2021-11-24 19:44:19	johnkeats7	ertiportline, if X is a vector field, at least for small time t there is a flow phi_t. let's take the case of a metric g defined near p. then it makes sense to take (phi_t^* g)_p for small t. the flow phi_t makes you go a little bit away from p, where g is still defined, and then you pull it back to p
2021-11-24 19:44:22	ertiportline	its 90 pages. So its pass my reading limits

2021-11-24 19:44:33	johnkeats7	this is a family of metrics at p, so you can take d/dt|_{t=0} of that

2021-11-24 19:45:04	ertiportline	johnkeats7, what's phi_t^* ?

2021-11-24 19:45:24	johnkeats7	pullback metric.
2021-11-24 19:45:43	johnkeats7	more explicitly:
2021-11-24 19:46:50	johnkeats7	(L_X g)(W, Z) = d/dt|_{t = 0} g(D_p phi_t . W, D_p phi_t . Z) where g is calculated at phi_t(p)

2021-11-24 19:47:53	mycroftiv	that paper doesnt claim to prove Riemann, it makes a statistical argument about unlikeliness of violation
2021-11-24 19:47:57	dude12312414	sounds like bullshit, there is no experimental approach that could prove a mathematical theorem
2021-11-24 19:48:30	dude12312414	and i believe there are already a lot of arguments about the "unlikeliness" of violation
2021-11-24 19:48:35	ertiportline	johnkeats7, what the dot in "D_p phi_t . W" means?
2021-11-24 19:48:41	dude12312414	which is why mathematicians believe RH is true in the first place
2021-11-24 19:48:51	johnkeats7	the derivative of phi_t at the point p applied to the vector W
2021-11-24 19:49:24	ertiportline	Ok, let me digest for a second.
2021-11-24 19:49:54	[itchyjunk]	when you have physics as a hammer, maybe everything looks like statistical inference :D
2021-11-24 19:51:21	johnkeats7	ertiportline, the intuition is: the flow of X allows you to push vectors along it. you push W, Z along for time t, compute their inner product (according to g at that new point), and see how this changes
2021-11-24 19:52:12	johnkeats7	so if the flow of X tends to preserve inner products you get 0, and if it tends to change them a lot you get a big number
2021-11-24 19:52:27	johnkeats7	so L_X g measures how much the flow of X preserves or not g

2021-11-24 23:20:26	isekaijin	Now, if X is horribly pathological as previously said, then X itself need not be compact.

2021-11-24 23:21:42	tomtomgps	Hi, I have to show that linear temporal logic formulas are tauotologies.  The first formula is FGp => GFp  where p \in AP.  I belive this is a taurtology because if we have finally globally p it means that after a certain rank we always have p. So that means  for every rank we can always find a bigger rank so thatw e have p
2021-11-24 23:22:09	tomtomgps	is this correct ?
2021-11-24 23:24:17	johnkeats7	isekaijin, this is topology, all functions are at least continuous

2021-11-27 23:33:23	isekaijin	My guess would be the following. Let H be the subgroup of G generated by {-1, 2, 3, 5, 7}. Since H is Abelian and finite, it can be written as F/F', where F is a free Abelian group of finite rank, and F' is a subgroup of F (necessarily again free Abelian of finite rank). Find an expression F/F' where F' is as small as possible.

2021-11-27 23:38:57	tomtomgps	Ok, my prof apparentlyt sent an email to the class saying « a basis or relztions is the minimal system of generators (of the relation groupe =. a module of ZZ) »  The relation group is the kernel of the homomorphim ZZ^n -> ZZ/NZZ^* that sends (e_1,…..e_n) to p_1^e_1 …  p_n^e_n. where p_1,…. p_n {-1, 2, 3, 5, 7} so n = 6

Then the linear combinations that are zero in G (or, equivalently, in H) form a free Abeilan subgroup F' of F. Find a basis of F'.

2021-11-27 23:56:17	mycroftiv	if your foundation proves that triangles have 8 sides and there are less reals than natural numbers, you are in trouble
2021-11-27 23:56:59	isekaijin	The one thing that is nice about CT and TT is that they rely less on encodings. And, when they do rely on encodings, at least the encodings are more “natural”. You can make more uniform choices “across the whole universe”, rather than the super ad hoc choices “on a per set basis” that set theory forces you to make.

2021-11-28 00:00:41	isekaijin	Another thing that CT (no idea about TT) has going for it is that it makes it easier to work with spaces that are awkward when regarded primarily as sets of points.
2021-11-28 00:01:02	isekaijin	For example, the fiber product of schemes is defined by a universal property.
2021-11-28 00:01:19	isekaijin	And the underlying set of the product is not necessarily the Cartesian product of the underlying sets of the factors.
2021-11-28 00:01:43	isekaijin	So saying that everything is “a set plus...” is really missing the point.

You have an integer y, and want a polytime randomized algorithm that finds an input x such that f(x) <= y with probability greater than half.  How to do it?  (Here polytime actually means polynomial in the number of gates of C)
2021-11-28 00:40:54	addem	I thought, pick a random input and do it m times.  Then the probability of success is 1-(1-y/2^n)^m.  Set this greater than 1/2 and solve for m.

2021-11-28 01:55:16	cherim	2/R^2 is "for sufficiently large R" in Borcherds' Cauchy
2021-11-28 01:55:57	Z-module	greenbagels: I think so
2021-11-28 01:56:47	cherim	After division by z^4 and factoring out 1/R^2 he gets (1+O(1/R^2))/(1+O(1/R)) which has limit 1 as R->inf, which does not imply it is eventually <=1 but certainly implies it's eventually <=2

That would do it then, along with the topology theorem that a given subset Y of a complete metric space X has a compatible complete metric iff Y is a G_delta in X.

Question: What allowed me to write g(z) as z^n + q(z)p(z). Does this have a name or do you know a reference where i can

2022-03-25 18:58:48	deadmund	Yes, I do know about gaussian elimination / row reduction.  I was asking about the "cross multiplication" technique.  Which, seems to just be a special case of this determinent approach.

2022-04-14 21:51:03	dalcde	If you have "something" over K, you can "descend" it down to "k" by taking Galois fixed points

2022-04-14 21:51:39	dalcde	Spec is contravariant

2022-04-14 21:53:43	dalcde	So Grothendieck's idea was to generalize the notion of "cover" to allow for these situations, and in this formalism Spec K -> Spec k is a cover.

2022-04-14 21:54:32	isekaijin	I can see how Spec(K) -> Spec(k) is a cover, and Gal(K/k) is the group of deck transformations...
2022-04-14 21:54:34	dalcde	For example, one way to define cohomology is via Cech covers
2022-04-14 21:54:46	dalcde	And you can translate this to the world of schemes
2022-04-14 21:54:47	isekaijin	What's a Čech cover again?
2022-04-14 21:55:12	dalcde	Well the idea is that you find a covering where all pieces are affine, with trivial cohomology
2022-04-14 21:55:32	dalcde	And Mayer--Vietoris allows you to glue all these trivial cohomology things back to say what the cohomology of the whole space is
2022-04-14 21:55:45	dalcde	Cech cohomology is a way to make this more formal, and (sometimes) agrees with singular cohomology
2022-04-14 21:55:49	isekaijin	By “affine”, do you mean A^n, or more general affine varieties?
2022-04-14 21:55:57	dalcde	Well in topology I mean contractible
2022-04-14 21:56:23	isekaijin	Mmm...
2022-04-14 21:56:57	dalcde	Not sure what exactly is the correct thing in algebraic geometry; the actual Cech cohomology is slightly different
2022-04-14 21:57:09	→	sonny has joined ##math
2022-04-14 21:57:10	dalcde	Anyway the point is that cohomology is something that can be phrased in terms of covers
2022-04-14 21:57:10	→	morte_ has joined ##math
2022-04-14 21:57:20	dalcde	And you can take this definition to algebraic geometry
2022-04-14 21:57:34	dalcde	and get new cohomology theories for schemes
2022-04-14 21:57:36	isekaijin	I think I'd have to see it first with manifolds.
2022-04-14 21:57:43	dalcde	For fields you get Galois cohomology, which you already know
2022-04-14 21:57:53	dalcde	In general what Grothendieck produced was etale cohomology
2022-04-14 21:58:05	dalcde	which he used to prove Weil's conjectures
2022-04-14 21:58:20	dalcde	isekaijin: Just pick your favorite manifold (e.g. a sphere) and compute its cohomology from scratch.

2022-04-14 21:59:02	isekaijin	Thanks for the explanation, but it'll take me a while to fully make sense of it.
2022-04-14 21:59:13	dalcde	Well that's maths
2022-04-14 21:59:32	isekaijin	Why can't it be easy like it was in undergrad and early grad courses?

2022-04-14 22:00:35	dalcde	It's inevitable
2022-04-14 22:00:42	dalcde	One keeps on studying maths until it is too hard for them
2022-04-14 22:00:44	dalcde	And then they stop
2022-04-14 22:00:56	dalcde	(because it's too hard; duh)
2022-04-14 22:01:27	isekaijin	That's okay, but I'm kinda disappointed that the point where it's too hard arrived too early.
2022-04-14 22:02:06	dalcde	It's actually a very neat picture
2022-04-14 22:02:15	dalcde	once you get your head around it
2022-04-14 22:02:36	dalcde	and then it's just inconceivable to not think of spaces that way
2022-04-14 22:02:48	isekaijin	Mmm.
2022-04-14 22:03:27	isekaijin	I also vaguely remember reading that there are actually several Grothendieck topologies one can consider for algebraic varieties.
2022-04-14 22:03:40	dalcde	Yeah
2022-04-14 22:03:46	dalcde	People spend a lot of time thinking about these things
2022-04-14 22:04:10	isekaijin	For manifolds, usually the cohomology of a manifold doesn't depend on whether we use singular cohomology, cellular cohomology, de Rham cohomology (if we don't mind discarding torsion information), etc.
2022-04-14 22:04:16	isekaijin	Is it also this way for algebraic varieties?
2022-04-14 22:04:54	dalcde	Oh they can be *very* different
2022-04-14 22:04:59	isekaijin	Damn.
2022-04-14 22:05:42	dalcde	Well etale and Zariski are very different
2022-04-14 22:06:01	dalcde	I think etale and other things people care about tend to often be closely related, but proving that may be hard
2022-04-14 22:06:15	dalcde	I don't know enough about algebraic geometry to give a more useful answer

2022-04-14 22:07:44	dalcde	Okay here's another useful thing to consider
2022-04-14 22:07:58	dalcde	It makes a lot of sense to consider covering spaces as "open covers" of some sort
2022-04-14 22:08:06	isekaijin	Sure.
2022-04-14 22:08:08	isekaijin	That's intuitive.
2022-04-14 22:08:09	dalcde	because locally the two are indistinguishable, and we want to work locally.
2022-04-14 22:08:15	isekaijin	Indeed.
2022-04-14 22:08:20	dalcde	For spaces it doesn't matter, because what I said is literally true
2022-04-14 22:08:25	←	cgadski has quit (Read error: Connection reset by peer)
2022-04-14 22:08:39	→	DoYouKnow has joined ##math
2022-04-14 22:08:54	dalcde	So you can replace "open covers" with the version that allows covering spaces and most things you say about them will still hold.
2022-04-14 22:08:58	isekaijin	Since it's literally true for spaces, we axiomatize it, and find “true-ish” analogues for varieties?
2022-04-14 22:09:19	dalcde	Yeah it turns out for varieties, the version that allows covering spaces is the more correct one, for many purposes.
2022-04-14 22:09:35	→	Wh0 has joined ##math
2022-04-14 22:09:39	dalcde	And Grothendieck topologies and sites are the technology you need to formalize how exactly you want this to work.

2022-04-14 22:09:53	isekaijin	I guess it helps us work around the fact that Zariski opens are seldom small enough?
2022-04-14 22:09:57	←	rawley has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
2022-04-14 22:10:05	dalcde	I think that's one way to phrase it
2022-04-14 22:10:41	dalcde	But I think the true reason is that you don't want to think of Spec R as a point, even though that is true from a Zariski point of view
2022-04-14 22:10:56	dalcde	Instead you want to think of it as Spec C quotiented out by complex conjugation
2022-04-14 22:10:59	dalcde	(R is the reals)
2022-04-14 22:11:05	isekaijin	The way I'm thinking it is “maybe we don't have enough literal open covers, but we might have enough «covers with self-overlaps»”?
2022-04-14 22:11:08	dalcde	and Spec C is what is truly a point
2022-04-14 22:11:22	dalcde	because C is algebraically closed and has no automorphisms.
2022-04-14 22:11:38	dalcde	Normal topological spaces don't let you encode this fact
2022-04-14 22:11:46	dalcde	If you start with a point and quotient it, it is still a point.
2022-04-14 22:11:59	dalcde	The etale topology lets you record this fact by letting Spec C be a 2-fold cover of Spec R
2022-04-14 22:12:12	isekaijin	Oh, that's nice.
2022-04-14 22:12:20	dalcde	All of field theory is broken if you don't remember this Galois action
2022-04-14 22:12:29	dalcde	And you can only imagine it is more broken for things that are not fields.
2022-04-14 22:12:42	isekaijin	Yeah.

2022-04-14 22:13:17	isekaijin	Actually, I've always thought of Spec(K) to be a [K:k]-fold open cover of Spec(k) anyway, even without a formalization, but if Grothendieck topologies are what it takes to formalize it, then that's really good motivation.
2022-04-14 22:13:23	dalcde	where you want to quotient out by something even more complicated, and remember the quotient properl.y

2022-04-14 22:14:48	isekaijin	Then what is?
2022-04-14 22:14:56	dalcde	It's just writing down the properties of open covers / covering spaces that you need to "do topology"
2022-04-14 22:15:06	dalcde	The hard work is actually writing down the topology itself
2022-04-14 22:15:16	dalcde	And proving it has the right properties.
2022-04-14 22:15:26	→	[-_-] has joined ##math
2022-04-14 22:15:29	dalcde	In the same way the usual notion of a topological space is annoying and hard to get your head around
2022-04-14 22:15:51	dalcde	But the actual important and useful things to do are to express things you intuitively consider spaces in this formalism
2022-04-14 22:16:03	dalcde	And show that they are not stupid (e.g. R^3 is not homeomorphic to R^2)
2022-04-14 22:16:03	isekaijin	Oh.
2022-04-14 22:16:46	dalcde	And maybe define things like homology and cohomology and prove something interesting like Brouwer's fixed-point theorem.
2022-04-14 22:17:17	dalcde	Of course, finding the right definition of a topology isn't easy, if you don't already know it.
2022-04-14 22:17:35	dalcde	But that's just the beginning
2022-04-14 22:17:46	isekaijin	Okay, so in this case I should find a definition of Grothendieck topology in a book, and construct Grothendieck topologies for concrete varieties?

2022-04-15 17:17:35	bollu	I'm trying to understand what the formal definition of a proper class is. As far as I can tell, it's literally _any_ formula in first order logic + a belongs relation?
2022-04-15 17:18:05	bollu	So I can even write things like C := \forall x. T, and this is a class
2022-04-15 17:18:15	bollu	and we "psychologically" interpret this as collecting sets?
2022-04-15 17:18:25	bollu	but it in itself is not a set?
2022-04-15 17:18:48	oxide	greenbagels: they aren't, but the artin-schreier theorem will show that the algebraic closure of hyperreals will be of char 0 and transcendence degree 2^aleph_0, so it is isomorphic to C
2022-04-15 17:21:30	river	bollu: yes the key is that you cannot quantify over these

2022-04-15 17:59:12	Jong	exactly
2022-04-15 17:59:37	greenbagels	So... what stops you from just using a gaussian? I think I don't understand what the dots represent
2022-04-15 17:59:38	Jong	I didn't say gaussian because the image of gaussian is 2d, whereas I'm asking for a 2d version of gaussian

2022-04-15 18:02:34	Jong	yeah, so if you replaced the y axis with color--black signifying very dense, and white signifying empty--the gaussian distribution would fade to from white to black and back to white
2022-04-15 18:02:45	greenbagels	Right
2022-04-15 18:03:02	lericson	oh you want the gaussian probability density function?

2022-04-15 18:04:12	greenbagels	You're basically picturing compression waves with your dots picture

2022-04-15 18:04:46	greenbagels	But if you plot pressure vs distance for a compression wave, you get a sinusoid, but they're the same picture

2022-04-16 00:43:36	oxide	since the subspace <x> is just kx for k in Z_2, how many elements are there in <x>

2022-04-16 00:51:25	somiaj	invertable over Z_2 is going to be a far different ratio
2022-04-16 00:51:27	CarloWood	If you have some more time; here is a test program that shows this: https://wandbox.org/permlink/sYYuedoJue6g1yMj
2022-04-16 00:52:01	CarloWood	It is "wiping" a matrix if that is the right word - but if you scroll allll the way down to the end, you see it ends up with column with only zeroes.

2022-04-16 00:58:33	CarloWood	I just did
2022-04-16 00:59:01	CarloWood	I want to solve  K M = L, where K and L are known.
2022-04-16 00:59:24	isekaijin	And K is a square matrix?
2022-04-16 00:59:25	CarloWood	An example with *small* matrices is:
2022-04-16 00:59:44	CarloWood	//               ⎡z d ⎤ <-- msb
2022-04-16 00:59:44	CarloWood	//   ⎡ 1 0 1 0 ⎤ ⎢y c ⎥   ⎡ 1 0 ⎤

2022-04-16 00:59:55	CarloWood	eew - no nice format
2022-04-16 01:00:22	isekaijin	If you want to solve a system of linear equations, why not use Gaussian elimination?
2022-04-16 01:00:41	CarloWood	That's what I am doing I think - except that I invented it myself :p
2022-04-16 01:00:43	isekaijin	Especially over F_2, where computing multiplicative inverses is easy.
2022-04-16 01:00:53	isekaijin	Gaussian elimination doesn't require computing any matrix inverses.
2022-04-16 01:01:05	CarloWood	I am not - K isn't even square
2022-04-16 01:01:30	CarloWood	What I want is to XOR rows of that left matrix until I get:
2022-04-16 01:01:39	CarloWood	//   ⎡ x 1 0 0 ⎤
2022-04-16 01:01:39	CarloWood	//   ⎢ x 0 1 0 ⎥
2022-04-16 01:01:39	CarloWood	//   ⎣ x 0 0 1 ⎦
2022-04-16 01:02:11	CarloWood	And while doing so - I never seem to get that - it always gets stuck with an all zero row or column.
2022-04-16 01:02:54	CarloWood	(XOR being subtracting when using Z2, of course)
2022-04-16 01:04:05	isekaijin	What data structure are you using to represent your matrices? Each row is a bit vector?
2022-04-16 01:05:03	CarloWood	What my code does is start in the right-most column and then find the first '1', starting to look for that from the top. When it finds one - it uses it to make the target row (that would be the bottom row for the right-most column) have a '1' in the right place; and then uses that target row to remove all the other ones in that column.
2022-04-16 01:05:17	CarloWood	isekaijin: yes
2022-04-16 01:05:32	isekaijin	That seems right, indeed.
2022-04-16 01:05:34	CarloWood	Each row is uint64_t - where the least significant bit is column 0

2022-04-16 01:08:43	isekaijin	Okay, in that case, it's true that the system doesn't have a unique solution.
2022-04-16 01:08:58	CarloWood	hmm

2022-04-16 01:10:32	CarloWood	So, I should continue when the whole column is zeroes?
2022-04-16 01:11:15	isekaijin	But if you have a column full of zeros, then that's totally fine.
2022-04-16 01:11:22	isekaijin	And, yes, you should just continue with the next column.

2022-04-16 01:25:55	caveman	he means max uncertanity.
2022-04-16 01:25:59	isekaijin	Oh, okay.
2022-04-16 01:26:07	isekaijin	So, p = 0.5 means max uncertainty?
2022-04-16 01:26:14	isekaijin	(For a Bernoulli-distributed variable.)
2022-04-16 01:26:19	CarloWood	Then if one of them has entropy 1, the xor has that too.  And if both have entropy 0, then the xor too.  But no way, ever will the result have entropy 1 when both inputs have entropy 0.5 obviously.
2022-04-16 01:26:27	CarloWood	Hence that I said that it feels like "no".

I'm having trouble figuring out

2022-04-16 16:57:37	zeroc00l0	Because, if a^t = b, then every power of b is a power of a, and so the group generated by b is a subset of the group generated by a.  And, if a subset has the same size as the set, then they are equal, so because o(a) = o(b) the two generated groups are equal.

2022-04-16 17:07:53	CarloWood	I suppose that column 5 (that has a 1 in L at the top), being [x0 x1 x2 x3 ...]^T together with the top row of K results in the equation: x0 + x1 + x2 = 1, and that I am allowed to pick anything I want that work - right?

2022-04-16 18:42:55	river	oh t is just a number
2022-04-16 18:43:00	river	it's not transpose or something
2022-04-16 18:43:41	river	a^t = b implies o(a^t) = o(b) = o(a)
2022-04-16 18:43:49	river	this proves that <a^t> = <b> = <a>
2022-04-16 18:43:55	river	so we do get the result

2022-04-17 07:48:31	Z-module	PlanckWalk: I feel silly for not seeing this earier today. If A is any algebraic irrational in R, or actually in C for that matter, then cos(pi A), sin(pi A) are both transc. because: assume at least one algebraic. Then cos^2 + sin^2 = 1 forces the other to be algebraic too, giving us that  cos(pi A) + i sin(pi A)  is algebraic, but this is  e^(i pi A) = (-1)^A   which can't be algebraic, by Gelfond-Schneider.

2022-04-17 11:22:27	greenbagels	ok so if a=0, the lambda equation will be an integer only if 2 divides x^2/y
2022-04-17 11:22:52	greenbagels	in other words x^2/y has to be an integer, right
2022-04-17 11:23:41	hashfunc1d0a	i would assume so, but using the above arguments i presented it doesn't give me an integer

2022-04-17 11:37:34	greenbagels	yeah so /2y doesnt literally mean take a fraction
2022-04-17 11:37:41	greenbagels	it means find the mult. inverse of 2y, and then multiply
2022-04-17 11:37:42	hashfunc1d0a	oh my goodness
2022-04-17 11:37:47	greenbagels	i.e. 3x^2 * (2y)^-1

2022-04-17 15:45:15	pikapika	we can take any reals to multiply an element of our space according to the definition of the space, ie af(x), etc
2022-04-17 15:45:34	pikapika	can we have that a itself be a function of x?

2022-04-17 15:46:47	greenbagels	a being a function of x is just asking if, given a continuous function f(x), whether a(x)*f(x) is continuous
2022-04-17 15:47:36	greenbagels	for any arbitrary function a(x)
2022-04-17 15:48:00	pikapika	Yes the result has to be an element of the space too
2022-04-17 15:48:40	greenbagels	right but if you're talking C[a,b] then your space is just all continuous functions on [a,b]
2022-04-17 15:48:49	pikapika	Yeah C[a,b]
2022-04-17 15:49:06	pikapika	so is the 'field' in this case also a set of functions
2022-04-17 15:49:14	pikapika	or is the field still only the set of reals
2022-04-17 15:50:55	greenbagels	hmm
2022-04-17 15:51:17	greenbagels	i think its an infinite dimensional vector space over reals, or a finite one over continuous functions

2022-04-17 15:57:47	pikapika	greenbagels, in the normal definition of a space, we just have our elements of the set be functions instead of vectors
2022-04-17 15:58:15	greenbagels	pikapika: the definition of a function space doesnt require the concept of vector space, which i think you are implicitly adding onto it
2022-04-17 15:58:32	greenbagels	yes it is true that C[a,b] is a vector space over whatever field the functions are defined on
2022-04-17 15:58:34	pikapika	It is from a text on vector spaces
2022-04-17 15:59:00	greenbagels	ok then yes you should assume its a vector space over whatever field each f is defined on

2022-04-17 16:10:23	[-_-]	what are those?
2022-04-17 16:10:40	pikapika	greenbagels, one way I am thinking of is, can we find a set of coefficients not all zero, corresponding to each possible value of t that makes the sum 0
2022-04-17 16:10:50	pikapika	in that sense the "coefficients" can themselves be functions of t
2022-04-17 16:11:19	pikapika	ie say for t=0, we have a0,b0,c0,...
2022-04-17 16:11:25	pikapika	for t=1, we have a1,b1,c1,...
2022-04-17 16:11:26	pikapika	so on
2022-04-17 16:11:40	pikapika	in this way, a instead can be seen as a(t),b as b(t) and so on
2022-04-17 16:11:45	greenbagels	you can only treat the set of functions as the underlying field if they actually form a field
2022-04-17 16:12:01	pikapika	and thus a(t)f(t) + b(t)g(t) + c(t)h(t) +... = 0
2022-04-17 16:12:26	pikapika	greenbagels, the "field" in this case is the full C[a,b]
2022-04-17 16:12:43	pikapika	we are given some functions (ie "vectors") from it and are to prove them dependent
2022-04-17 16:13:00	pikapika	for example, going back to normal geometrical vectors

2022-04-17 16:13:59	greenbagels	are you sure? take f(x) = x in C[-1, 1]; what is this functions inverse?

2022-04-17 16:15:44	greenbagels	pikapika: every nonzero element of a field *has* to be invertible

2022-04-17 16:15:53	pikapika	but
2022-04-17 16:16:00	pikapika	the elements of a vector space are vectors, not fields

2022-04-17 16:19:10	greenbagels	not as a vector space over C[a,b] (that doesn't make sense; see the earlier invertibility concern)
2022-04-17 16:20:24	pikapika	greenbagels, a vector space was defined with a "real" and a "vector"; with the usual properties of associativity, commutativity, additive, multiplicative inverses etc existing for each vector and the "real" distributing as multiplication over sum of "vectors"

2022-04-17 16:35:12	pikapika	I forgot that
2022-04-17 16:35:14	pikapika	Good point yeah
2022-04-17 16:35:30	pikapika	it doesn't matter if I assign 0 to the other functions next
2022-04-17 16:35:37	greenbagels	pikapika: there is an idea you are getting somewhat close to though
2022-04-17 16:36:05	pikapika	what is it?
2022-04-17 16:36:10	greenbagels	it is true that the constant functions f(x) = k (for any real k) are naturally isomorphic to real numbers themselves
2022-04-17 16:36:28	greenbagels	so you can think of 2f(x) + 3g(x) as a(x)f(x) + b(x)g(x)
2022-04-17 16:36:43	greenbagels	but you can't expand beyond that and go, what if a, b are just part of all continuous functions on some interval?
2022-04-17 16:36:47	greenbagels	because that set does not form a field
2022-04-17 16:36:48	pikapika	oh ok, in this case a(x) is the specialized function a(x)=2
2022-04-17 16:36:52	greenbagels	yes
2022-04-17 16:37:24	greenbagels	you can consider "over the set of constant real-valued functions" but really that's just the same field as R itself
2022-04-17 16:37:39	pikapika	Yeah it would be pointless to do that
2022-04-17 16:38:26	pikapika	oh right, I also forgot the theorem that if a subset is dependent then the whole set is also dependent; again hinging on the "not all zero" fact

2022-04-17 20:12:10	chiselfuse	From a deck of 52 cards, a 5-card hand is dealt. How many distinct hands can be formed if there are **at least** 2 Queens?
2022-04-17 20:12:23	chiselfuse	What I thought of initially is just    4C2 x 50C3
2022-04-17 20:13:22	chiselfuse	because we select 2 out of the 4 queens in deck, then there's 50 cards left out of which we select 3, those 3 could contain 2 queens, 1 queen or none (which is fine because they said **at least**)

2022-04-17 20:14:23	chiselfuse	but the correct solution written is     4C2 x 48C3    +    4C3 x 48C2    +   4C4 x 48C1
2022-04-17 20:15:19	river	if you take away the 4 queens, deal a 4 card hand then add one of the 4 queens.. you have (52-4 choose 4)*4 options for a 5 card hard with exactly 1 queen in it
2022-04-17 20:15:35	river	so you could do A - B - C to get the total number with 2 or more queens
2022-04-17 20:16:21	river	looks like they instead calculated hands with 2 queens + hands with 3 + hands with 4

2022-04-17 21:03:04	bildramer	that was the important difference
2022-04-17 21:03:22	bildramer	when you take distances, obviously you take differences between vectors, and _not_ between the coordinates of the same vector
2022-04-17 21:03:55	bildramer	or: if you have f and g then you first do h = f - g and take the norm of that
2022-04-17 21:06:15	bildramer	chiselfuse: best way is probably "all 5-card hands minus those with exactly zero queens minus those with exactly one queen"

2022-04-17 21:07:46	bildramer	yes but it's _trivial_ to explain the difference if you just use more numbers or more letters, instead of trying to put it into words

2022-04-17 21:09:42	bildramer	think of L1 distance as adding horizontal and vertical distance, whereas L2 is a straight diagonal line

2022-04-18 01:27:24	river	special relativity
2022-04-18 01:27:38	river	if you send light or radio waves from A to B, it travels at light speed to get there
2022-04-18 01:27:42	river	so it does take time
2022-04-18 01:27:51	river	but if you do the same thing on a fast moving train

2022-04-18 01:28:04	river	it does not take light speed + train speed
2022-04-18 01:28:26	river	so there's this whole idea of a lorentz transformation

2022-04-18 03:30:37	Imk0tter	it starts at 0,0.5 on the circle (the left side)
2022-04-18 03:30:54	Z-module	even so: there are exactly two points on the circle that will be at exactly that distance
2022-04-18 03:31:05	Imk0tter	the line segmenet can have a length between 0 and 1 and will be on the top half of the circle
2022-04-18 03:31:17	Z-module	not as you describe, it won't

2022-04-18 03:31:45	Imk0tter	here let me make a picture
2022-04-18 03:32:07	Z-module	If we use the standard x-y-plane, with the x-axis the horizontal one, and coordinates meaning (x,y), then (0, 1/2) as at the top, so the other point will be in either the lower left or the lower right

2022-04-18 03:35:25	Z-module	in standard coorinate practice, the starting point of that segment in the picture, at left, is at  (-1/2, 0), not  (0, 1/2)
2022-04-18 03:35:39	Imk0tter	it starts at the bottom left and goes to the top right

2022-04-18 03:36:12	Z-module	x-coordinates go left-right with negatives to the left of the origin;  y-coordinates go up-down, with negatives below the origin
2022-04-18 03:37:53	Imk0tter	here's another example (ignore the yellow lines): https://i.ibb.co/ccB3nRP/math-notes-3.jpg
2022-04-18 03:40:01	Z-module	oh, I guess in the first picture you were putting the origin at the lower left square corner. Doesn't really matter.
2022-04-18 03:40:24	Imk0tter	you can say it starts at 0,0
2022-04-18 03:40:34	Imk0tter	and goes to 0.5 to -0.5
2022-04-18 03:40:44	Z-module	Anyway, now draw the missing segment from that middle point to the top end of the 0.848427-length segment, and now you have a triangle where those two smaller sides have length exactly 0.5
2022-04-18 03:40:53	Z-module	now now you can do trig

2022-04-18 05:33:13	parsnip	you can try to prove it, but that's my initial conjecture
2022-04-18 05:33:20	Emorii	"There exists z such that (x, y, z) \in K"
2022-04-18 05:33:23	parsnip	then you need to paramerize, i guess
2022-04-18 05:33:45	parsnip	Emorii: so i think you can prove towards that statement, and use that wording in the statement

2022-04-18 05:34:06	parsnip	"have you used all the facts given"

2022-04-19 13:32:40	Ongonn	I wish to determine a tangent to a point on the ellipse that I get when the plane x - y + 2x = 2 intersects the ellipsoid 2x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 4. Is the cumbersome algebra z = sqrt(2x^2 + y^2 - 4) = (1/2)(2 - x + y) = z  necessary?
2022-04-19 13:33:22	Ongonn	Or how do I go about it?

2022-04-19 20:40:28	cadmio	1. n may be assumed to be odd; 2. when n is odd, factoring n is equivalent to determining two integers x and y such that (1) holds
2022-04-19 20:40:36	W	cadmio, it comes from N = ab implying N = ((a + b) / 2)^2 - (a - b) / 2)^2; generally when factorizing it's because you have a number written out in decimal or binary that is easy to spot if is divisible by two
2022-04-19 20:40:55	W	you want to do away with that /2 so you just work with plain integers

2022-04-19 23:28:13	ivanq	riber Eh, not quite. The method you described does indeed assume sqrt indicates *any* root, but there's a way to avoid that if the number of variables is <= 4 (sorry, the bit about 5 variables seems to have turned out false). Say you want to check if sqrt(a) = sqrt(b) + sqrt(c) + sqrt(d). Rewrite that as sqrt(a) - sqrt(b) = sqrt(c) + sqrt(d). Make sure that a >= b, square both sides, both LHS and
2022-04-19 23:28:15	ivanq	RHS are now of kind (square root + constant). Rearrange s.t. LHS containg difference of two roots and RHS is rational, check the signs and square again, you now have (square root + constant) in LHS and a rational expression in RHS. Rearrange and square again, voila.

2022-04-19 23:38:15	Jacques	I'm tryin' to count the flops for Q * a, where Q is a 3x3 Givens rotation and a is 3x1 column matrix with real entries. So we have to do three dot-products. One dot-product has 5 operations: product add product add product.
2022-04-19 23:38:15	Jacques	So in total there are 3*5 = 15 flops?
2022-04-19 23:38:17	greenbagels	i think one of the nice things about mathematics is it gives you plenty of sources of interesting 4 digit pins
2022-04-19 23:38:36	Jacques	I guess Q being a Givens rotation doesn't matter

2022-04-19 23:43:07	greenbagels	dude12312414: no, but thats a good one, now that im reading more about it
2022-04-19 23:43:18	Jacques	Because really the Givens rotation is just acting on the 3-1 = 2 elements of a
2022-04-19 23:43:41	greenbagels	i guess really it's not that it gives you sources of 4 digit pins, but reasons to find a given 4 digit number as notable haha

2022-04-19 23:46:04	Jacques	I feel like multiplying by 1 or 0 does not count as a flop because otherwise any factorization would have the same flop count basically
2022-04-19 23:46:47	greenbagels	dude12312414: haha true

2022-04-19 23:49:47	Jacques	Oh, hold the phone:
2022-04-19 23:49:47	Jacques	The way Givens rotations are applied is:
2022-04-19 23:49:48	Jacques	1. Multiply on the left by a Givens rotation to kill below-diagonal entry. --> First column will take 3-1 = 2 Givens rotations.
2022-04-19 23:49:49	Jacques	2. Each matrix product with the column vector will take three applications of the dot product: 3*5 flops.
2022-04-19 23:49:49	Jacques	3. Therefore, the total flops to convert the first column is: 2 * (3*5) = 30
2022-04-19 23:49:56	Jacques	How's that?

2022-04-20 00:36:06	Jacques	Let's first square matrices: A is a nxn matrix.
2022-04-20 00:36:07	Jacques	1. (n-1)! Givens rotations are required.
2022-04-20 00:36:07	Jacques	2. Each Givens rotation requires n dot-products. The dot-product requires n products and n-1 additions: n * (n-1). In total: n * (n * (n-1) ) = n^2 (n-1) = n^3 - n.
2022-04-20 00:36:08	Jacques	3. Total: (n^3 - n) * (n-1)!

2022-04-20 00:53:30	Z-module	One of the weirdest factoids about Fibonacci numbers I've ever seen: The Fibonaccis are exactly all the positive real values of P(x,y) as x, y range over Gaussian integers Z[i], where p(x,y) = -y^5 + 2x y^4  + x^2 y^3 - 2x^3 y^2 - (x^4 - 2)y
2022-04-20 00:53:43	greenbagels	also it seems unlikely that an algorithm in use would be O(n!); this makes it very impractical to try to use for anything larger than very small matrices

2022-04-20 03:49:59	EvilDMP	in my case, the x and y are indeed positions in 2D space, and pw1 and pw2 are the pulse-widths supplied to motors in a certain mechanism. So I for any x/y combination, I'd like a function that gives me those pulse-widths.

The servos are rather imprecise and also non-linear, but I can get a good curve by getting numpy to give me a function that fits real-world data of servo angles to pulse-widths.

2022-04-20 04:04:08	EvilDMP	However, there are also mechanical distortions and limitations, so being able to associate actual x.y positions with pulse-widths would help take care of that.

2022-04-20 04:14:25	jbis	thats the better question
2022-04-20 04:14:55	greenbagels	jbis: for your original question its pretty straightforward; the dice rolls are independent, so you can look at P(1st is even) * P(2nd is even) * P(3rd is odd)
2022-04-20 04:15:03	greenbagels	but then you have to consider the fact that order doesnt matter
2022-04-20 04:15:13	greenbagels	so it could be EEO, or EOE, or OEE
2022-04-20 04:16:21	greenbagels	alphamule's suggestion about symmetry is probably to point you towards teh fact that this is identical to the chance of OOE, or OEO, or EOO
2022-04-20 04:16:33	jbis	so you just * 3

2022-04-20 06:46:13	Galois	these concepts already show up in linear algebra. The sum of the roots of the characteristic polynomial of a matrix is the trace of the matrix.
2022-04-20 06:46:23	Galois	The product of the roots is the determinant.
2022-04-20 06:47:09	Galois	X^2 + aX + q in this context is the "minimal polynomial" of z, which means it's the smallest polynomial of which z is a root
2022-04-20 06:47:39	Galois	a characteristic polynomial is also (sometimes) a minimal polynomial: by the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, the original matrix is a root of its own characteristic polynomial

2022-04-20 06:49:13	rex	I see
2022-04-20 06:49:32	Galois	I guess my real point is, if you have studied enough algebra, you build up such a vast iceberg of facts and connections surrounding each concept, that statements such as what Hungerford wrote are, indeed, trivial

2022-04-20 06:52:29	Galois	well, the norm is like (-1)^n times the constant term

2022-04-20 06:53:59	Galois	with resultants you can do things like calculate traces and norms without actually finding the roots
2022-04-20 06:55:26	Galois	For example: In[1]:= Resultant[x^2-2, (y+x)^2-3, x]
2022-04-20 06:55:27	Galois	Out[1]= 1 - 10*y^2 + y^4
2022-04-20 06:55:46	Galois	this says the trace of sqrt(2)+sqrt(3) is 0, the degree is 4, and the norm is 1
2022-04-20 06:56:41	rex	I don't think we covered resultants in this lecture. Is there a more special subfield of algebra where they get introduced?
2022-04-20 06:57:07	Galois	no, you're kind of on your own. Resultants are a magic tool for calculation that nobody covers.
2022-04-20 06:57:24	Galois	essentially by doing a Euclidean algorithm like GCD computation you get all this information
2022-04-20 06:57:34	Galois	(Sqrt[2]+Sqrt[3]) (Sqrt[2]-Sqrt[3]) (-Sqrt[2]+Sqrt[3]) (-Sqrt[2]-Sqrt[3]
2022-04-20 06:57:38	Galois	) = 1

2022-04-20 14:41:30	river	i.e. a logic is consistent if it cannot prove "false"
2022-04-20 14:41:34	brownorange	yes and that makes sense too
2022-04-20 14:41:39	river	so we just went from A -> B to ~B -> ~A
2022-04-20 14:41:53	river	but instead of ~B they call it Con
2022-04-20 14:42:18	brownorange	but i think the relatives of provability of false, there's something wrong about applying contraposition to it

2022-04-20 14:44:07	brownorange	yes, but i think what A,B are are important in this case
2022-04-20 14:44:09	river	in classical logic you can verify this by using a truth table
2022-04-20 14:44:46	brownorange	the provability of false depends on the formal system
2022-04-20 14:44:49	river	there are other logics where A -> B is a much stronger statement than ~B -> ~A, even in that setting it is still trye that A -> B implies ~B -> ~A
2022-04-20 14:44:56	river	but it is not true that ~B -> ~A implies A -> B
2022-04-20 14:45:10	river	but this is a diversion, in classical logic these two statements are equivalent

2022-04-20 14:46:07	river	certainly the statement Prov(⌜⊥⌝) is dependent on your logic
2022-04-20 14:46:16	river	in PA for example, we might use 1=0 for ⊥
2022-04-20 14:46:29	river	so what we are saying is that PA is consistent if you cannot prove 1=0
2022-04-20 14:46:45	river	what if you can prove 3=2 though? well that still implies 1=0

2022-04-20 14:54:42	brownorange	but then since (A->A) is provable, then according to this piece of reasoning, we can prove GPA, since we can prove (A->A)
2022-04-20 14:55:28	brownorange	so (A->A) -> Falsum , which means math is provably inconsistent, according to this  take.
2022-04-20 14:55:38	brownorange	that's a huge issue.
2022-04-20 14:56:26	→	blueberrycrop has joined ##math
2022-04-20 14:57:00	river	A -> A is weaker than Con(PA)
2022-04-20 14:57:09	river	in some sense
2022-04-20 14:57:18	river	A -> A is a tautology, we have a proof of it
2022-04-20 14:57:49	river	Con(PA) is much less obvious - we believe it to be true as it has not been disproved. Also it has been proven assuming a particular infinite cardinal called episilon_0
2022-04-20 14:58:39	brownorange	if we assume PA, we surely have (A->A).
2022-04-20 14:58:48	brownorange	so it's fair game to say what (A->A) should imply or not imply
2022-04-20 15:00:04	river	in classical logic every statement is equivalent to 'T' True or ⊥ False
2022-04-20 15:00:18	river	at least in some sense
2022-04-20 15:00:25	river	in practice, this is not actually true
2022-04-20 15:00:35	river	because there are statements which cannot be proved
2022-04-20 15:00:51	river	but internally classical logic believes that everything is true or false
2022-04-20 15:01:06	river	A->A = True
2022-04-20 15:01:21	river	Con(PA) = True? or Con(PA) = False?
2022-04-20 15:01:58	river	from the inside of PA, if either of these statements were proven it would cause an explosion

2022-04-20 15:02:40	river	from the outside, e.g. from ZFC or any system with epsilon_0 we can both prove that PA cannot prove Con(PA) or ~Con(PA). And we can prove Con(PA)
2022-04-20 15:02:59	river	so there are levels to logic and what can be proven
2022-04-20 15:03:25	river	even though ZFC can talk about PA, ZFC cannot prove Con(ZFC) or ~Con(ZFC)
2022-04-20 15:03:36	Franciman	river: what is epsilon_0 ? sorry
2022-04-20 15:03:53	river	Franciman: you know how in PA, induction is done over omega (= {0,1,2,3,...})
2022-04-20 15:04:05	river	and this is how PA gets all of its "proof strength" e.g. it lets you prove x+y = y+x
2022-04-20 15:04:16	Franciman	yes
2022-04-20 15:04:43	river	in set theory we can do induction using a higher infinite cardinal epsilon_0 to prove things that require transinfinite descent
2022-04-20 15:04:48	brownorange	let me put it this way. NONE of the provably true propositions of PA  should provably imply the liar paradox , else we can prove false
2022-04-20 15:05:50	river	brownorange: that's true
2022-04-20 15:07:18	brownorange	so take any proposition let's call it X.   X -> ¬ProvPA(⌜GPA⌝) or X -> ProvPA(⌜GPA⌝),  is a problem because proving X means proving false

2022-04-20 15:09:26	river	it's called the principle of explosion that False -> anything
2022-04-20 15:09:39	river	so False or anything equivalent works fine in X's position

2022-04-20 15:10:03	brownorange	so if X was false, it's still bad to prove X in that case

2022-04-20 15:11:46	brownorange	if it's a proposition we can prove, replace X with it. i think it's noteable (A->A) is provable
2022-04-20 15:12:16	river	ok so if you can prove X and X -> ¬ProvPA(⌜GPA⌝), this proves ¬ProvPA(⌜GPA⌝)
2022-04-20 15:12:42	brownorange	correct
2022-04-20 15:13:18	river	what is the 1st incompleteness theorem
2022-04-20 15:13:43	river	it constructs a formula GT such that:  GT ↔ ¬ProvT (⌜GT⌝).
2022-04-20 15:13:45	brownorange	and same for the other case btw. you prove X. and X -> ProvPA(⌜GPA⌝), this proves ProvPA(⌜GPA⌝).  we don't want that either
2022-04-20 15:13:59	river	so if you prove ¬ProvPA(⌜GPA⌝) you have proven GT

2022-04-20 16:20:48	river	fast growing functions like ackermann and busy beaver are interesting
2022-04-20 16:22:22	river	and of course the independence of the continuum hypothesis. but i have not understood this myself..
2022-04-20 16:22:37	river	(1963 by Paul Cohen)
2022-04-20 16:22:50	river	that is much more of a direct impact of godels work
2022-04-20 16:23:26	brownorange	if proving ConsPA, means we can prove Falsum. But proving !ConsPA, means we can prove Falsum as well. Isn't that the logical contradiction ((A->False) && (!A->False))?
2022-04-20 16:25:33	river	yes, that seems to produce a contradiction
2022-04-20 16:25:48	brownorange	but i accept the 1st incompleteness theorem so i guess i can't say that
2022-04-20 16:26:09	river	well let's examine that, because it seems correct - there must be something quite subtle there
2022-04-20 16:28:14	river	P \/ ~P is an axiom.  So we have Con(PA) \/ ~Con(PA)
2022-04-20 16:28:40	river	we know that Con(PA) implies G (from 2nd) which implies False (from 1st)

2022-04-20 19:39:19	Fangs	it was for an assignment too
2022-04-20 19:41:09	Fangs	one 0-cell because usually those diagram you'd write for genus g-surfaces (and non-orientable variants too) usually only has one. only one 1-cell because "the mobius strip has only one boundary!"
2022-04-20 19:41:37	Fangs	the worst part is, the circle along the boundary doesnt even generate the fundemental group of the mobius strip.. its twice that

2022-04-21 01:52:00	Ongonn	Yea but what I mean is that if the point is t, then for the one curve I take the one endpoint where it ends to be x(t-1) and the other curve starts at x(t+1).

2022-04-21 04:15:10	Jacques	2. Per Givens rotation is a matrix-vector product which yields: m multiplications and m-1 additions --> m + (m-1) = 2m - 1

2022-04-21 05:53:45	Jacques1887	Okay. Well, then I think I agree with you.
2022-04-21 05:53:45	Jacques1887	Consider a m x n matrix with m > n. We were consider how many lower off-diagonal there were. This is:
2022-04-21 05:53:46	Jacques1887	(m-1) + (m - 2) + ... + (m - n) = (m-1)m/2 - (n-1)n/2,
2022-04-21 05:53:46	Jacques1887	which almost looks like what you wrote
2022-04-21 05:55:08	Jacques1887	This is (i think)** ^
2022-04-21 05:55:47	PlanckWalk	That doesn't look right
2022-04-21 05:56:05	PlanckWalk	E.g. imagine m=1000 and n=1
2022-04-21 05:56:27	PlanckWalk	(m-1)m/2 will near 500 000
2022-04-21 05:56:54	Jacques1887	hm. I did try it with a test case on my board.. let me see if I made arithmetic error
2022-04-21 05:58:41	Jacques1887	I consider a 6x3 matrix. m = 6, n = 3.
2022-04-21 05:58:41	Jacques1887	5*6/2 - 2*3/2 = 15 - 3 = 12. which is correct
2022-04-21 06:00:12	Jacques1887	All I did was consider the sum: 5 + 4+ 3 + 2 + 1. We want 5 + 4 + 3.
2022-04-21 06:00:13	Jacques1887	So: 5*6/2 - 2*3/2

2022-04-21 08:45:31	dude12312414	yeah this one is invertible
2022-04-21 08:46:07	dude12312414	in that case you take those excess bits that overflow and you move them back to the other end
2022-04-21 08:46:22	dude12312414	so it's all still there, just rearranged
2022-04-21 08:47:00	caveman	so, let's look at cryptos:  some do this:  32-bit add with carry/overflow, then rotate to left by some amount, then xor against something.
2022-04-21 08:47:10	→	Jacques1887 has joined ##math
2022-04-21 08:47:46	caveman	suppose that you know the cleartext prior to add-rot-xor, will you be able to tell how much it got xored, how much it got rotated, and how much it got added?
2022-04-21 08:49:18	caveman	imagine cleartext is number 5, and the ciphertext you got is 234423442.  and you know that this happened:  ((5 + A) <<< B) XOR C  =  234423442.  can you solve this equation and get A, B and C?
2022-04-21 08:49:33	dude12312414	so you have something like C = ((P + x) <<< y) ^ z and you want to find x, y, z given P and C?

2022-04-21 08:50:41	dude12312414	if P has lots of zeros it's also easier

2022-04-21 08:52:26	dude12312414	yeah you won't have a unique solution for sure

2022-04-21 08:52:54	dude12312414	you could always set x = y = 0 and let z = P ^ C
2022-04-21 08:53:16	int-e	But... this isn't really how people do it in crypto. The rotations will have offsets, but most of the x and/or z will vary.
2022-04-21 08:54:18	dude12312414	yeah in reality you will have to satisfy a lot of other constraints for x, y, and z and you won't just be able to set them to convenient values like that
2022-04-21 08:54:24	int-e	Anyway. This is very much of an XY problem I'm afraid.
2022-04-21 08:55:39	int-e	In reality there will be pretty long sequence of operations, and eventually all input bits will affect all output bits and soon after that point things become infeasible.

2022-04-21 08:58:44	int-e	The reason for not varying those is that barrel shifters are far more expensive than crossing some data lines

2022-04-21 08:59:17	caveman	^ is this what you mean by offset?  you meant varying rotation amounts?
2022-04-21 08:59:39	int-e	But those values are all known in advance, not dependent on the input data or key. so they're constant.
2022-04-21 08:59:42	dude12312414	as opposed to something like data[i] <<< data[j]
2022-04-21 09:00:12	caveman	is it better to not have it depend on key?

2022-04-21 09:12:50	dude12312414	well i'm not sure exactly how this is implemented in terms of logic gates and such,
2022-04-21 09:13:06	dude12312414	but if the shift is constant you don't need any logic gates at all
2022-04-21 09:13:22	dude12312414	you just cross some wires in the order you want
2022-04-21 09:13:28	caveman	yes.
2022-04-21 09:13:35	dude12312414	i think that's what int-e was saying
2022-04-21 09:14:32	caveman	probably.
2022-04-21 09:15:37	caveman	so, back to the original question:  we got:

2022-04-21 09:15:41	caveman	23443242 = ((5 + x) <<< y) ^ z
2022-04-21 09:15:43	caveman	question is:  how to obtain x, y and z?
2022-04-21 09:15:57	dude12312414	there is not enough information for that
2022-04-21 09:16:20	dude12312414	as I said, a trivial solution would be x = y = 0, z = 23443242 ^ 5
2022-04-21 09:16:35	caveman	you mean that there are many solutions?

2022-04-21 09:19:27	caveman	but if that smart person has a better job (usually he does), then it becomes a net-loss for life forms.  this is why smarties have to say ``okay i'm out''.
2022-04-21 09:20:27	caveman	if it was only:

2022-04-21 09:20:30	caveman	then we can solve it with 1 unique solution.  obviously.  right?

2022-04-21 09:25:24	dude12312414	you don't have to test it
2022-04-21 09:25:41	dude12312414	you automatically know that (x, y) = ((23443242 >>> y) - 5, y) is a solution

2022-04-21 09:34:39	dude12312414	well i guess i'm trying to understand what is your actual goal here. Do you have a cipher (or some general class of ciphers) you are trying to analyze/break? Are you trying to know why these XOR, ADD and ROTATE operations are used?
2022-04-21 09:36:21	caveman	yes.  i am trying to see if there is a value to add z.  e.g. why not just stop at x and y.  so i 1st did it with just x and we got a single solution.  with y?  many possible ones.  now why add z?  wasn't it already enough that adding y made it many solutions?
2022-04-21 09:36:33	caveman	C = ((P + x) <<< y) ^ z    <---   referring to this.

2022-04-21 09:37:31	dude12312414	just because there are many possible solutions doesn't make the cipher hard to break
2022-04-21 09:38:39	dude12312414	and again this is only one small part of a more complex algorithm (hopefully)
2022-04-21 09:39:14	dude12312414	where x, y, z and other parts of the secret key will get mixed up with other plaintext bits and so on
2022-04-21 09:39:48	dude12312414	and these things will add more constraints to the correct values of x, y, z
2022-04-21 09:40:38	dude12312414	so that a solution like (x, y, z) = ((23443242 >>> y) - 5, y, 0) will likely not work
2022-04-21 09:41:03	dude12312414	and the more complex the operations become, the harder it is to come up with a simple parametrized solution like that
2022-04-21 09:41:16	dude12312414	so you end up having to break it into cases
2022-04-21 09:41:43	dude12312414	like, if y = 0, then x = z + 1, but if t = 5 then y = z ^ x, etc

2022-04-21 09:42:18	dude12312414	and the number of cases will grow exponentially for a long time before it eventually reduces to one (the "actually correct" solution)
2022-04-21 09:42:19	caveman	imo it's ok if (x, y, z) = ((23443242 >>> y) - 5, y, 0) worked for one block where the attacker knows P already.  because that specific (x,y,z) that he finds there will not work for the next block that contains the P that he doesn't know.

2022-04-21 09:53:08	caveman	then he will discover wrong keys x,y,z, and he can take selfies next to them.  then that's all about it.  the x,y,z, that he took selfies next to, won't help him decrypt P that he doesn't know.
2022-04-21 09:53:39	dude12312414	lol taking selfies after breaking a cipher, that would be nice

2022-04-21 09:55:27	dude12312414	i mean we're not discussing any specific cipher here
2022-04-21 09:55:41	dude12312414	so this can either be easy or hard depending on the cipher used
2022-04-21 09:55:45	caveman	true.  just the concept add-rot-xor.
2022-04-21 09:55:59	dude12312414	that's still too vague
2022-04-21 09:56:15	dude12312414	you can come up with ARX ciphers that are easy to break and some that are hard
2022-04-21 09:56:48	caveman	true.
2022-04-21 09:57:51	dude12312414	the general approach you would have to try to break it is to look for cases where many of the operations simplify

2022-04-21 10:00:07	dude12312414	it's kinda vague to explain it like that

2022-04-21 10:04:06	dude12312414	i mean sure, if your actual cipher is just that, then ^z is useless. But also your cipher is really nothing but a substitution cipher on whatever bitsize words you're using
2022-04-21 10:05:32	dude12312414	well i shouldn't say that it is useless

2022-04-21 10:06:16	dude12312414	it allows for more complex substitutions, but usually these things are say 32-bit words which are easily bruteforceable

2022-04-21 10:07:10	caveman	what if we make x and y, each, 128 bits?  i.e. each a couple of 64 bits?
2022-04-21 10:08:26	dude12312414	ok let's say all of these x, y, z, P and C are 128-bit "words"
2022-04-21 10:08:55	dude12312414	and you have access to three pairs (P_1, C_1), (P_2, C_2) and (P_3, C_3) of plaintext/ciphertext
2022-04-21 10:09:07	dude12312414	so that gives you a system of 3 equations

2022-04-21 10:10:14	dude12312414	one obvious thing to try is to look at C_1 ^ C_2
2022-04-21 10:10:19	→	ville has joined ##math
2022-04-21 10:10:29	dude12312414	and C_1 ^ C_3
2022-04-21 10:10:35	dude12312414	that would eliminate zz
2022-04-21 10:11:08	dude12312414	C_1 ^ C_2 = ((P_1 + x) <<< y) ^ ((P_2 + x) <<< y) = ((P_1 + x)^(P_2 + x)) <<< y
2022-04-21 10:11:33	dude12312414	C_1 ^ C_3 = ((P_1 + x) <<< y) ^ ((P_3 + x) <<< y) = ((P_1 + x)^(P_3 + x)) <<< y
2022-04-21 10:11:44	dude12312414	so now you have 2 equations in 2 unknowns
2022-04-21 10:12:02	caveman	even without elimination like that, i guess, if adversary knows C_1, C_2, C_3, then he can transform the 3 equations into a single equation in terms of x (or y, or z)?
2022-04-21 10:12:49	caveman	say, adversary already knows C_i and P_i

2022-04-21 10:17:15	dude12312414	so you pick P_1 = 0, P_2 = 1 let's say
2022-04-21 10:17:51	dude12312414	and P_3 = -1 let's say also
2022-04-21 10:17:58	dude12312414	(mod 2^128)
2022-04-21 10:18:11	dude12312414	then you get
2022-04-21 10:18:30	dude12312414	C_1 ^ C_2 = x^(1 + x) <<< y
2022-04-21 10:18:43	dude12312414	C_1 ^ C_3 = x^(-1 + x) <<< y
2022-04-21 10:19:23	dude12312414	now unless x has a long string of consecutive 1's or 0's, 1 + x and -1 + x will have most bits identical to those of x, except the lsb
2022-04-21 10:20:26	dude12312414	so very likely that x^(1 + x) will be something like 0000000000000000.....0010110 or something like that
2022-04-21 10:20:56	dude12312414	and then from C_1 ^ C_2 you could see how much this pattern is shifted

2022-04-21 11:04:51	dude12312414	well by applying your inductive definition you can get the ++ to act on the outer paretheses

2022-04-21 11:34:58	Ongonn	int-e So there is this axiom (principle of mathematical induction) that says. Let P(n) be any property pertaining to a natural number n. Suppose that P(0) is true, and suppose that whenever P(n) is true, P(n++) is also true. Then P(n) is true for every natural number n. This should be a helpful axiom for saying that the only numbers in N are those
2022-04-21 11:34:58	Ongonn	which can be obtained from 0 and the increment operation in order to exclude things numbers like 0.5.
2022-04-21 11:35:18	Ongonn	But the definition of natural numbers is informal. Is this normal?
2022-04-21 11:35:40	Ongonn	Like, theoretically why isn't the increment of 0, 0.5?
2022-04-21 11:37:08	Ongonn	In some sense the natural numbers are already given by assumption that the increment of 0 is 1.

2022-04-21 11:40:30	Ongonn	So you can use a linear system as a counter example. Consider,  [x_1 x_2 \ 2x_1 2x_2][a \ b]
2022-04-21 11:40:32	caveman	but what is a consistent system?  like the n variables are referring to the same ones over the equations?
2022-04-21 11:41:13	Ongonn	It means that the solution set is not empty.

But yes, if it is you would require n equations for n variables since you need n pivots. If you have less equations than variables and the system is consistent, you would have free variable(s), and for

2022-04-21 13:13:34	alphamule	There's a related situation to the Highlander Problem.  Imagine you have molecules of some gas in a vacuum.  Now imagine that every time two of them collide, you remove one of them, thus increasing the thiness of the vacuum (in terms of molecules).
2022-04-21 13:13:56	ihate	it just depends on what distances you are uses to state the theorem
2022-04-21 13:14:21	alphamule	It gets slower and slower to have random collisions.   So, what time scales for a given vacuum level are needed?  :)
2022-04-21 13:14:23	stanrifkin	ihate: i see. the direction matters and both -1 and 1 are right

2022-04-22 01:22:49	greenbagels	it doesnt change the x value of the minimum, it just shifts teh function up and down by a constant

2022-04-22 06:20:05	greenbagels	theyre simply torturing themselves by not understanding it the first time
2022-04-22 06:20:08	greenbagels	its that easy
2022-04-22 06:20:21	ihate	that's like using college algebra to justify hating abstract algebra
2022-04-22 06:20:49	isekaijin	What's “college algebra”?
2022-04-22 06:21:00	ihate	pre-precalc algebra
2022-04-22 06:21:01	greenbagels	the law of cosines gave me ptsd so now no one deserves group theory
2022-04-22 06:21:24	ihate	"Simplify a^(1/4)a^(-1/3)"

2022-04-22 06:22:36	isekaijin	I can't wait for the day we have sufficiently advanced ring and module theory to eliminate all things real analysis.
2022-04-22 06:23:13	greenbagels	i cant wait for the day all module theorists quit and start painting in the countryside
2022-04-22 06:24:02	ihate	(tbf I think hating any field is pretty odd :3)
2022-04-22 06:24:09	isekaijin	I'm not being entirely serious.

2022-04-22 11:09:01	femjewel	Hey caveman
2022-04-22 11:10:58	caveman	in a last episode of mine in this very same mathematics' channel here, we concluded that a consistent linear system of n many equations, each of which has n many variables (same n many variables), is necessarily enough to solve all those n many variables.
2022-04-22 11:11:32	caveman	in today's episode, we allow ourselves to go one notch forward, and see if we can ask a harder variation of that question, and still get the same nice answer.
2022-04-22 11:11:56	femjewel	I'm not entirely sure what that means as I'm not advanced enough, but that sounds really cool
2022-04-22 11:12:01	caveman	today's question is this:  what if those n many equations are non-linear.  will it suffice to have a system of n many of them to get those n many variables worked out?

2022-04-22 15:03:33	CarloWood	femjewel: I think that flat Earthers are just scared; the idea of gravitation not being in the same direction everywhere is a concept that instills primal fear or even panic attacks in them. No amount of reasoning or math will make them "see" the reality.
2022-04-22 15:06:04	CarloWood	It has parallels with the fact that so many scientists cling to the idea that there is only one reality (I think that everything that can happen happens, and we're just aware of one tiny insignificant piece of all existing realities). They don't WANT to make a theory in which there is more than one reality.

2022-04-22 17:25:55	isekaijin	It has to be such that Z/nZ can only be embedded in S^1 in a way that respects the cyclic order of the points.

2022-04-22 17:36:43	taeaad_	The simpler form of their argument (just giving the strategy) appears in commentary by Stewart and Plotkin: use (8/9, 1/2, 1/3, 0) as your 1-step-remembering strategy for (both cooperated, I cooperated they didn't, they cooperated but I didn't, both defected).

2022-04-22 17:37:12	taeaad_	This is called Extort-2, which means you force the opponent to give you double what they make, or else, both parties perpetually defect.
2022-04-22 17:37:47	taeaad_	But actually there is a linear relationship that leads to Extort-n strategies.
2022-04-22 17:39:54	taeaad_	What they call an "evolutionary" player means a player that just explores how to make points without trying to establish the other player's strategy. Their point is that such a player could "accept" the extortion by the other player simply based on the fact that the extorting player is forcing either mutual defection, or to have n times the "evolutionary" player's points.

2022-04-23 08:54:13	isekaijin	Let G x X -> X be a continuous action of a topological group. I want to show that, if G is connected, then G acts trivially on both H_*(X) and H^*(X).
2022-04-23 08:54:20	isekaijin	I think I have the intuitive idea right.
2022-04-23 08:55:20	isekaijin	If g, h \in G are in the same connected component, then we get from that a chain homotopy between the maps g, h induce on the singular chain complex of X.

2022-04-23 11:11:34	jodmos	ok.

2022-04-23 11:14:52	tusko	Suppose we were using a hash function h(x) = x mod 2. If we select x_i, x_j \in Z can we say that Pr[h(x_i) = i] and Pr[h(x_j) = i] is independent?
2022-04-23 11:15:02	tusko	I'm stuck on the fence about it
2022-04-23 11:18:42	PlanckWalk	tusko: Do you mean that x_i and x_j are independent random variables?
2022-04-23 11:18:57	PlanckWalk	And you're trying to find out whether h(x_i) and h(x_j) are independent?
2022-04-23 11:19:01	tusko	They are random integers, yes
2022-04-23 11:19:10	jodmos	anyone interested by question just below topos theory in terms of fundamentals ? just a tad more general than topoi ?
2022-04-23 11:19:36	PlanckWalk	You can just apply the definition to that then :)
2022-04-23 11:20:01	PlanckWalk	As in, easily, on paper.
2022-04-23 11:20:04	tusko	Ok, cool, thank you!
2022-04-23 11:21:07	PlanckWalk	There is an edge case to consider, but it's very straightforward.

2022-04-23 11:27:14	Jacques1887	Anyone remember my Givens rotation complexity question? If so, my final answer is:
2022-04-23 11:27:15	Jacques1887	6 * SUM_{k=0}^{n-1} [(n-k)(m-k-1)]
2022-04-23 11:27:15	Jacques1887	The reference claimed the complexity was 3mn^2 - n^3, which my answer has if we pick those terms. I assume it is because they are assuming, since m >> n, that those two terms dominate. Though why the "3mn" term in the resulting expansion is not included is not clear to me.

2022-04-23 18:23:03	niemand	Hi! Has the following a name: I take two sets S₁ and S₂ and combine every element in S₁ with every element in S₂ with an operation ⊕ (similar to the cartesian product)
2022-04-23 18:26:35	→	foobaz212 has joined ##math
2022-04-23 18:28:17	Pollion	You mean creating a new set S with each element of the form axb with a in S_1 and b in S_2 ?
2022-04-23 18:28:26	niemand	yes
2022-04-23 18:28:28	Pollion	You might want to look at Tensor Product
2022-04-23 18:31:16	←	foobaz212 has quit (Ping timeout: 252 seconds)
2022-04-23 18:31:30	Pollion	Or direct product, not sure exactly what you are looking for
2022-04-23 18:31:48	Pollion	Do you sets S1 and S2 have an algebraic structure you want to keep ?
2022-04-23 18:36:15	niemand	Well, I'm not sure what you mean by algebraic structure, but in my specific case S₁ and S₂ are the same and ⊕ has the type: S×S → S (I should have told you that from the beginning, so sry about that :S)
2022-04-23 18:37:11	niemand	So I don't think tensor product and indirect product really capture what I'm thinking of

2022-04-23 18:38:32	niemand	I can also just say that the every element in the set is getting connected with every element in the set with the operation or sth.
2022-04-23 18:39:01	niemand	well, afaik the cartesian product creates a tuple
2022-04-23 18:39:45	Pollion	Which is an element of S

2022-04-23 18:41:26	Pollion	well if you define S to be the set of tuples (a, b), then it is (by definition). Am I missing something in what you want ?
2022-04-23 18:41:57	niemand	Yes, S shouldn't have to be the set of tuples and in my case it isn't

2022-04-23 18:45:39	niemand	Yes it's essentially a generalization of the cartesian product
2022-04-23 18:45:57	Pollion	You can also call it the (complete) bipartite graph with Vertices being S1 and S2, and your operation is just the operation of joining elements together by an edge
2022-04-23 18:46:56	ℹ	specing_ is now known as specing
2022-04-23 18:47:54	Pollion	I think it will depend on the context. But I'm not sure it is really such a generalization of cartesian product.

2022-04-23 23:12:14	audio	for the function f(x) = x^2, if point P is (1,1) and point Q is (2,4), the slope of the line PQ is 3, because delta_x/delta_y is 3/1. If dy/dx is delta_x/delta_y as delta_x approaches 0, how does 3 (or 5 or 7 or 9, etc) become 2x?
2022-04-23 23:12:58	greenbagels	audio: the reason it is 2x is because that is what the slope of the tangent line is as a function of x
2022-04-23 23:13:16	audio	greenbagels i know that, but i am trying to solve algebraicly
2022-04-23 23:13:24	audio	algebraically*
2022-04-23 23:13:42	→	Inline has joined ##math
2022-04-23 23:13:55	somiaj	simplify ( (x+h)^2 - x^2 ) / h, which is the slope between (x, f(x)) and (x+h, f(x+h))
2022-04-23 23:14:01	greenbagels	^
2022-04-23 23:14:24	greenbagels	youre basically confused because you're comparing the result of plugging numbers into formulas with the formulas themselves
2022-04-23 23:14:36	audio	YES
2022-04-23 23:14:39	audio	yes*
2022-04-23 23:14:47	somiaj	oh in your example ( (1+h)^2 - 1^2 ) / h
2022-04-23 23:14:55	audio	somiaj i know the formulas
2022-04-23 23:15:00	Z-module	So instead, do what somiaj suggested there, with general x instead of some number
2022-04-23 23:15:52	audio	greenbagels so how would i make sense of delta_x/delta_y = 3 in the context of how delta_x/delta_y relates to dy/dx, is i guess what i'm asking
2022-04-23 23:15:56	audio	again, i know the formulas
2022-04-23 23:16:04	audio	that's not what i'm asking about
2022-04-23 23:16:23	somiaj	well in that case h = 1, so you have ( (1+1)^2 - 1^2 ) / 1 = 3
2022-04-23 23:16:30	greenbagels	so the numerical values of the slopes may not approach 2x, but they approach the value of 2x when x takes on a certain value
2022-04-23 23:16:35	somiaj	the nice thing about the formula, is you get the slope for any value of h, not just a single value of h
2022-04-23 23:16:35	Z-module	dy/dx is only a LIMIT of all those delta_y/delta_x values.  It might not exactly equal any of them.
2022-04-23 23:17:58	Z-module	also, you repeatedly wrote the delta fraction upside-down
2022-04-23 23:18:33	audio	woops
2022-04-23 23:19:01	Z-module	anyway, specific numeric delta values are mostly of no help at all here
2022-04-23 23:19:04	Z-module	do it in generality
2022-04-23 23:19:20	greenbagels	yeah you basically lose information once you plug x values in, so theres not really a way to help you go backwards
2022-04-23 23:19:28	audio	ok, thanks

2022-04-23 23:20:03	greenbagels	thats in general though, for this case, i guess you could go backwards by solving 2x = d if someone says "i know the slope is d at some x value; what is the x value?"

2022-04-24 06:36:56	greenbagels	Jacques: i think you asked a question earlier
2022-04-24 06:37:06	greenbagels	but i went to bed
2022-04-24 06:39:16	Jacques	greenbagels I was updating you on that problem I promised I would move on from. I solved it
2022-04-24 06:39:26	greenbagels	haha nice
2022-04-24 06:39:38	Jacques	it only costed nearly my sanity no worries
2022-04-24 06:39:50	greenbagels	oh i remember now
2022-04-24 06:40:01	greenbagels	i think they took all cubic terms in the expansion
2022-04-24 06:40:20	greenbagels	so you said they assumed m >> n but i think they assumed m and n were the same order
2022-04-24 06:40:27	greenbagels	so mn^2 is of the same order as m^3 and n^3
2022-04-24 06:40:34	Jacques	uhm. Yeah sorta kinda

2022-04-24 11:56:02	←	Pickchea has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2022-04-24 12:03:36	int-e	Well, usually these polynomials are chosen to make long division (in whichever form you think of it) pleasant... note how m(x) = x^8 + p(x) where the degree of p is as small as possible... this means that long division can eliminate 8 - deg(p) bits from the top in a single step. So if you multiply two degree seven polyonmials, the result has degree 14, and after two steps you'll be down to... 7 or...
2022-04-24 12:03:42	int-e	...less, not 6 or less, because you can't eliminate the x^7 term.
2022-04-24 12:04:00	int-e	There's also tricks with lookup tables (2^8 is small).
2022-04-24 12:04:38	int-e	Lookup tables may be a terrible idea if the context for this is a crypto primitive.
2022-04-24 12:05:09	int-e	(data-dependent memory access tends to be exploitable)

2022-04-24 12:08:32	tusko	int-e, yeah, I use a lookup table for the s-box. I might consider a lookup table here, too, but I was hoping I could just do something clever with calculating the inverse

2022-04-24 12:19:05	gohlzehn	Hey. So I'm doing some programming and I have drawn an arrow on a canvas that I've build, which shows like this: https://imgur.com/a/ZuXUNyt so in the image I've drawn 3 lines actually where the last two lines create the arrow head, but the arrow head is just two separate lines with both having x1, y1, x2, y2. So as you see in the image, I've added red text of the coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2)
2022-04-24 12:19:07	gohlzehn	which allows me to draw the middle line. So, the (x1, y1) is the initial point and the (x2, y2) is the point that is at the user's cursor position. In the 2nd arrow you see the arrow head is still in the same angle, so I need to adjust the (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) of the arrow head lines, but how do I do this? I came across this 2d rotation formule, but not sure if this is what I need:

2022-04-24 13:33:14	river	yes
2022-04-24 13:34:38	river	I was curious what the shape looks like
2022-04-24 13:34:39	river	https://www.desmos.com/calculator/qzxmgq8xvm
2022-04-24 13:34:46	river	here is an MRI scan of the shape
2022-04-24 13:34:53	river	you can use the z slider

2022-04-24 13:36:34	river	I inputted it incorrectly
2022-04-24 13:36:54	river	https://www.desmos.com/calculator/y9m0msr3ld here is what it actually looks like
2022-04-24 13:36:58	river	this looks much easier to calculate the volume of
2022-04-24 13:37:16	river	every slice in a donut
2022-04-24 13:37:32	river	so the basic way to find the area of volume of something is to use an integral
2022-04-24 13:37:47	river	in this case you could try to work out the two radius parameters of the donut slice at a given z
2022-04-24 13:37:52	river	and integrate over all those

2022-04-24 13:38:30	river	e.g. at z=1.6 you want some formula that takes in a=6 and gives you R_1 = 2, R_2 = 5.1
2022-04-24 13:38:36	river	(roughly)
2022-04-24 13:38:58	river	so the area of that slice is pi R_2^2 - pi R_1^2
2022-04-24 13:39:17	river	and the total volume of the shape is the integral of this ^ as a function of z
2022-04-24 13:40:50	Guest57	I will try that. I have only tried spherical coordinates.

2022-04-24 16:56:30	somiaj	we don't see where you are getting this extra, -2x^2 from, it is like you are putting this -2x^2 factor in twice
2022-04-24 16:57:10	somiaj	so maybe slow down, take (x-1) - (x+1) - 2(x-1)(x+1) and replace that full thing (in your original inequality) with -2x^2, what do you get?

2022-04-24 20:38:25	zeroc00l0	I want to prove that for all positive integers, a, b, d, f, if both a and b divide f and d = gcd(a, b), then (a*d^-1)(b*d^-1)*d divides f.  Is my argument correct?
2022-04-24 20:38:26	zeroc00l0	Suppose that a, b, d, and f are positive integers where a divides f, b divides f and d = gcd(a, b).  Using the fact that d divides both a and b, let a = (a')d and b = (b')d.  Since both a and b divide f, both (a')d and (b')d divide f.   (TA) For any positive integers, r, s, t, rs divides t if and only if r divides t(s^-1), so both a' and b'
2022-04-24 20:38:26	zeroc00l0	divide f(d^-1).  a' and b' must also be coprime and for any positive integers, r, s, t, if both r and s divide t and gcd(r, s) = 1, then rs divides t, therefore (a')(b') divides f(d^-1), and via TA, implies (a')(b')d divides f.

2022-04-25 01:54:41	Jacques6	Recall the exercise: what is the highest order approximation to v_m' possible using v_m, v_{m+1}, v_{m+2}.
2022-04-25 01:54:42	Jacques6	Here, v_{m+1} means v(x+1*h). v_{m+2} likewise.
2022-04-25 01:54:42	Jacques6	The linear combination v(x+2h) - v(x+h) yields an approximation to v' of order 1. This is not very good. Can we do better?
2022-04-25 01:54:43	Jacques6	We must consider what is restricting our access to a high power (it isn't your lack of bible study). We obtain the order 1 approximation due to the second derivative term in the Taylor series expansion when we solve for v': h^2 / h = h. To obtain an O(h^2) approximation, we must eliminate the second order derivative. This can be done by multiplying
2022-04-25 01:54:43	Jacques6	v(x+h) by 2^2.
2022-04-25 01:54:44	Jacques6	Observe:

2022-04-25 01:56:13	Jacques6	Considering only the second order derivative terms:
2022-04-25 01:56:13	Jacques6	2^2v(x+h) = ... + (2^2 h / 2!) v',
2022-04-25 01:56:14	Jacques6	-v(x+2h) = ... - (2^2 h /2!)v'
2022-04-25 01:56:24	Jacques6	err, v''
2022-04-25 01:57:20	Jacques6	Destroying the additional V terms via: -3v,
2022-04-25 01:57:20	Jacques6	we can obtain a second order approximation to v'.
2022-04-25 01:57:57	Jacques6	Can we do better? To do so we would need to kill the v''' term. That is possible via a similar construction as above, but now consider what happens when we explicitly solve for v'.
2022-04-25 01:58:35	Jacques6	The leading term is the second derivative as it was not eliminated which now has a coefficient of h. This yields a first order approximation
2022-04-25 01:59:09	Jacques6	Generally, we can eliminate any high order derivative term, but as the second derivative term always lives in these cases then the approximation will always be of order 1
2022-04-25 01:59:25	Jacques6	Hence, the highest order approximation to v'' using those three terms in a linear combination is: 2

2022-04-25 05:08:10	Ali_A	I am mostly programming, so it would be useful for me, to know the essence of problem solving with calculus, rather than knowing how to apply formulas, so that when I encounter a problem I would say "okay this sounds like something derivative would work upon' which is why I want to understand the foundation rather than general technique

2022-04-25 05:29:12	ihate	intro calculus is not that deep though; it is a *very* elementary toolset of mathematics that is probably best learned via rote memorization and practice problems.
2022-04-25 05:29:46	ihate	if you want to apply mathematics in practice, you'll likely need to learn some more specialized toolsets.
2022-04-25 05:30:04	isekaijin	Not that deep. The last course in our calculus sequence “only” uses ideas from algebraic topology, nothing too fancy...
2022-04-25 05:31:27	ihate	is basic algebraic topology deep?
2022-04-25 05:31:39	isekaijin	Of course, not for a mathematician's standards.
2022-04-25 05:32:01	isekaijin	But for a 20-something engineering student, it's absolutely brutla.

2022-04-25 05:34:43	isekaijin	My favorite moments are when they have the right idea, but don't know the terminology to say it precisely. For example, they want to parametrize a curve by [a,b], but traversed backwards, so they say [b,a], even though b > a.
2022-04-25 05:34:45	isekaijin	So, even though it's not “correct”, I give them full marks, because they're thinking the right way.

2022-04-25 05:37:21	ihate	"so they say [b,a], even though b > a." just redefine the notation obviously
2022-04-25 05:37:58	isekaijin	Using nonstandard notation is cool, but they'd have to define it explicitly.
2022-04-25 05:39:14	isekaijin	If they say “given two points p, q \in R^n, let [p,q] denote the segment from p to q, parametrized as (1-t)p + tq”, then that's totally awesome. I even did that in an operations research exam.

2022-04-25 06:24:59	PlanckWalk	If you're at 9 seconds, can you "jump" to 8 seconds?
2022-04-25 06:25:12	PlanckWalk	Or is it only forward (the usual state of affairs for movement in time)?
2022-04-25 06:25:44	dardo82	I’m referring to a video timeline so you can go backwards too...

2022-04-25 06:29:05	PlanckWalk	You coudl reach any second in a two minute timeline if the last was 81 seconds, though.
2022-04-25 06:29:24	PlanckWalk	And that's not quite the best you can do either.
2022-04-25 06:29:36	dardo82	Could you do it in 4 jumps?
2022-04-25 06:29:45	PlanckWalk	Not with those jump sizes
2022-04-25 06:30:05	PlanckWalk	I'm not sure whether you could do it with 4 jumps with a different set.
2022-04-25 06:31:14	PlanckWalk	No, you can't do it with 5 jump sizes and selecting at most 4.
2022-04-25 06:31:30	dardo82	Thanks for your help, I’d be interested in you elaborating on why it’s not the best you can do.
2022-04-25 06:31:36	PlanckWalk	Oh wait, I forgot the negatives

2022-04-25 06:35:48	PlanckWalk	If the last was 81 then you can reach any 5-digit balanced ternary number, i.e. -121 to +121

2022-04-26 11:41:51	kn07_	octave-lu is the octave lu function.

2022-04-26 11:58:26	Matt|home	is there any case where dividing by zero nets you infinity or is it always undefined
2022-04-26 11:58:28	Jacques1928	Yes.
2022-04-26 11:58:46	Jacques1928	though it depends I guess. If you have a structured matrix then you can use Givens
2022-04-26 11:58:56	ihate	Matt|home depends on context. sometimes it's convenient to say 1/0 = +oo
2022-04-26 11:59:07	ihate	i.e., context dictates if 1/0 is defined or not
2022-04-26 11:59:37	Matt|home	so infinity / 0 is either undefined or 1
2022-04-26 12:00:52	ihate	generally infinity / 0 is undefined. However, probably some situations might dictate that assigning infinity / 0 = 1 makes sens.

2022-04-26 19:47:43	Z-module	If you like, you can think of the board positions marked by column and rank numbers as integer lattice points (using just integers 1 - 8) on the plane R^2.  A line going through at least two of those lattice points is a board diagonal iff its slope in R^2 is 1 or -1, so, iff |its slope| = 1.  That's what the if (abs......)  thing is checking.
2022-04-26 19:48:49	relipse	what is R^2
2022-04-26 19:48:55	Z-module	R x R, the real plane
2022-04-26 19:49:03	Z-module	with (x,y) coordinates
2022-04-26 19:49:27	relipse	so how do you calculate the slope of 2 points?
2022-04-26 19:49:30	relipse	i'm so confused
2022-04-26 19:49:46	[itchyjunk]	rise/run
2022-04-26 19:50:06	[itchyjunk]	when rise == run, rise/run = 1
2022-04-26 19:50:12	Z-module	If (x,y), (x',y') are any two distinct points in R^2, with x != x' , then the line through those two points has slope  (y' - y)/(x' - x)
2022-04-26 19:50:49	relipse	so if you have a queen at 0,0 and 1,1 you can do 1 - 0 / 1 - 0 = 1
2022-04-26 19:50:51	Z-module	In your chess thing, the _R variables hold the rank = the y-coordinate, and the _C ones hold the column = the x-coordinate
2022-04-26 19:51:08	relipse	and because the slope is 1, it is on the same diagnol?
2022-04-26 19:51:09	Z-module	 |(y' - y)/(x' - x)| = 1   iff    |y' - y
2022-04-26 19:51:28	Z-module	sorry,  iff   |y' - y| = |x' - x|
2022-04-26 19:52:03	relipse	basically i can also juts calculate the slope, and if its 1, then its on the same diagnol?
2022-04-26 19:52:15	Z-module	yes, a line going through board squares is "diagonal" iff it changes vertically exactly as fast as it changes horizontally, in absolute terms
2022-04-26 19:52:23	[itchyjunk]	Apparently that "emergence of random structure" thing has application in cryptography and material physics already :x
2022-04-26 19:52:24	relipse	i see

2022-04-26 20:10:52	relipse	nice, math is pretty cool
2022-04-26 20:12:14	Z-module	Just think of it this way without all the symbols:  Squares A and B (distinct) are on the same diagonal    iff    When you start at A, and move horizontally (left or right) to reach the same column that B is on, and then you move vertically (up or down) to reach B, that horizontal distance = that vertical distance.

2022-04-27 21:35:15	river	why is r^hat in this? I do not understand what that menas
2022-04-27 21:35:23	river	the surface normal is in the r^ direction
2022-04-27 21:35:27	river	I guess it's to do with that
2022-04-27 21:35:52	river	but my integral is int_S sigma(r')/j^2 j^hat da
2022-04-27 21:36:29	river	so i end up with int_S sigma/j^2 R^2 sin(theta) j^hat r^hat  dtheta dphi
2022-04-27 21:36:34	river	can I have two hat things next to each other?
2022-04-27 21:38:11	river	well it's actually int_S sigma(r')/j^2 j^hat da' . and I do not know what the ' means

2022-04-27 21:39:27	somiaj	the unit vectors in polar/spherical coordinates are strange because their direction depends at what point you are at.
2022-04-27 21:39:34	river	yeah
2022-04-27 21:40:19	somiaj	but for polar coordinates you can draw a polar grid, https://images.template.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/21083140/Blank-Polar-Graph-Paper.jpg
2022-04-27 21:40:50	somiaj	Think of each of those as tiny rectangles. One dimension of the rectangle is dr (change in radius) and the other is (r dtheta) using s = r theta for the arc length along the curved side
2022-04-27 21:40:55	river	ooh
2022-04-27 21:41:08	somiaj	thus the area of one of those tiny rectangles is dA = r dr dtheta when you multiply them together
2022-04-27 21:41:17	river	that makes sense!
2022-04-27 21:41:35	somiaj	You can do a similar argument using spherical coordinates but you have two angles to work with and two 'radial' directions, so it requires a bit more geometry
2022-04-27 21:42:05	somiaj	This agrees with the formula you get from taking the determinant of the jacobian change of variables matrix

2022-04-27 23:05:39	Jacques	Maybe I'll figure that out later, ihate. But I think the way the exercise intended is my idea above since they talk about the Rayleigh quotient
2022-04-27 23:06:00	ihate	given  L_min Id ≤ A ≤ L_max Id, (a) follows immediately
2022-04-27 23:06:28	Jacques	given??
2022-04-27 23:06:48	dila	if a function has a continuous derivative each time you differentiate is there a name for it?

2022-04-27 23:07:08	greenbagels	or "smooth"
2022-04-27 23:07:32	dila	thanks. i thought smooth meant the derivative was continuous but not all derivatives
2022-04-27 23:07:47	dila	now i know :)
2022-04-27 23:07:54	ihate	that'd be "C^1 smooth"
2022-04-27 23:08:15	greenbagels	dila: yeah it depends on the author
2022-04-27 23:08:31	Z-module	dila, a small number of writers use "smooth" to mean C^1 = first derivative exists everywhere and is continuous everywwhere, but it's wrong-headed. The word "smooth" by itself really means C^infty = all derivatives exist, thus they are also all continuous automatically.
2022-04-27 23:08:38	sonny	that comma messed me up
2022-04-27 23:08:56	Z-module	I think this was sort of change of terminology trend over a long period
2022-04-27 23:09:08	ihate	Z-module I often use "smooth" to mean "sufficiently regular"
2022-04-27 23:09:08	greenbagels	sonny: if im being honest, when posting text like this, just writing sqrt() and "in" isntead of .| and (- is probably more readable

2022-04-27 23:12:35	Z-module	ihate, the line segments thing?
2022-04-27 23:12:50	ihate	it was existence of a C1 function with dense extrema or something

2022-04-27 23:12:56	dila	z^2 = (a + bi)^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 2abi
2022-04-27 23:14:25	Z-module	ihate, no, only differentiable, can't be C^1, because if f' is continuous and is 0 on a dense set, it's 0 everywhere.

2022-04-27 23:21:09	Z-module	ihate, yes, the paper did this: For any two disjoint countable sets A, B of reals (they can both be dense in R), there is an everywhere-differentiable f:R -> R  where the set of local maxima for f is A, and the set of local minima is B.  But such an f *can't* have f' continuous throughout some interval in which A and/or B is dense, since that would force f' to be identically 0 in that interval.

2022-04-28 07:43:50	greenbagels	in physics a lot of problem solving / sanity checking education stems from particular techniques taught in classes i'd say
2022-04-28 07:44:01	greenbagels	like unit checking, checking limiting cases of formulae, stuff liek that
2022-04-28 07:44:22	greenbagels	i think math typically stresses different skills, because you dont always have this context in problems
2022-04-28 07:44:59	greenbagels	but in some cases you still can; if a problem asks for the taylor series for cos, you can check your answer with limiting cases, and similar
2022-04-28 07:45:35	greenbagels	so i think it just boils down to either realizing these tricks you can do / being taught them, and then practicing them a lot

2022-04-28 14:24:45	oxide	first of all, since I,J are additive subgroups, you already know that I n J is also an additive subgroup if you've proved that the intersection of two subgroups is a subgroup

2022-04-28 14:39:12	Smilex	oxide, ok I'm trying to read the definitions, and I just realized that if an ideal is a subgroup, then it has to have the identity element, right? But if it has the identity element, then it is the entire ring... I must be wrong somehow

2022-04-28 14:47:20	Smilex	so the additive identity has to be in the intersection. Also the inverse of any element has to be in the intersection, because if a is in both groups, both groups also have a^(-1). The difficult part is closed under addition...

2022-04-28 15:38:47	int-e	well, consider U -> A and U -> B; you can only have {U}, {U,A} or {U,B} as visited nodes, not {U,A,B}.

2022-04-28 19:54:46	ian|	hello. i am interested in learning the steps to solve 'x + 1/x = 3'. is 'x^2 + 1 = 3x' correct?
2022-04-28 19:56:37	tolarz	your question is ill-posed.
2022-04-28 19:57:16	tolarz	Did you mean whether `x + 1/x = 3  => x^2 + 1 = 3x` is a valid step to do?
2022-04-28 19:57:27	tolarz	The answer is yes, via a multiplication of `x` on both sides.
2022-04-28 19:57:29	ian|	yes, my apologies
2022-04-28 19:57:48	←	JordiGH has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
2022-04-28 19:58:14	tolarz	Note that we don'T have `<=`
2022-04-28 19:58:27	tolarz	(Well, that might be up for debate.)
2022-04-28 19:58:38	specing	The <= is to test both candidates
2022-04-28 19:59:00	→	qu4nt1n has joined ##math
2022-04-28 19:59:09	ian|	okay, because of the square root having +/- values?
2022-04-28 19:59:56	←	qu4nt1n has quit (Client Quit)
2022-04-28 19:59:59	ian|	then we factor 'x^2 + 1'?
2022-04-28 20:00:00	specing	It's because you raised the order and thus introduced a new candidate by multiplying with x
2022-04-28 20:00:05	tolarz	We can start from ` x^2 + 1 = 3x` and do a case analysis:
2022-04-28 20:00:18	tolarz	case 1: x = 0, then the equality isn'T fulfilled anyway, so we can infer anything
2022-04-28 20:00:28	tolarz	case 2: x != 0, we can divide by 0 to get `x + 1/x = 3`
2022-04-28 20:00:33	tolarz	Thus in both cases we can infer `x + 1/x = 3`.
2022-04-28 20:00:39	tolarz	Thus we have <=.
2022-04-28 20:00:53	tolarz	Or am I missing sth?
2022-04-28 20:02:19	ian|	is factoring x^2+1 the next step?
2022-04-28 20:02:46	tolarz	`x^2 + 1 = 3x` is a classic quadratic equation
2022-04-28 20:02:50	tolarz	Apply your favorite method of solving it.
2022-04-28 20:03:04	ian|	ah, indeed
2022-04-28 20:03:05	tolarz	(You might be more used to the form `x^2 - 3x + 1 = 0`.)

2022-04-28 21:45:26	river	brownorange: remember a couple days ago you had a proof that seemed to show G I think. Maybe you already found out but Franciman found the mistake. It was a level issue again
2022-04-28 21:45:48	sonny	If x and y are linearly dependent vectors, their addition results in the zerov vector?
2022-04-28 21:46:04	river	https://pastebin.com/mfRCVC6S ah the paste has expired
2022-04-28 21:46:05	brownorange	@river yep. you can't show Prov('False')->False, as that is what consistency is. so that proof was wrong.

2022-04-28 21:49:36	somiaj	sonny: linear combination is a combaination of scalar multipication and addition, so it means more than x+y = 0, it means c_1 x + c_2 y = 0 for some c_1 and c_2 such that at least one is non-zero

2022-04-29 09:21:28	Fangs	I was trying to characterize what the coefficients are, and when some linear combination of tableux gives nabla(stuff) = 0
2022-04-29 09:22:01	Fangs	Jacques: they are young tableux
2022-04-29 09:22:05	int-e	ah, the constraints only work in one direction
2022-04-29 09:22:26	Jacques	they mean same thing
2022-04-29 09:22:30	Jacques	i just wanted to confirm
2022-04-29 09:23:23	int-e	And the D([ ][ ][ ]) = 3n [ ][ ] has a factor of 3 because you can remove any of those three squares...
2022-04-29 09:23:35	Fangs	yeah
2022-04-29 09:23:49	caveman	off-topic, but why is mathematics more right than mathematic (without s)?  and is it true that americans just learn one and this is why they have dropped the plural 's'?
2022-04-29 09:24:35	Fangs	https://usercontent.irccloud-cdn.com/file/kKB2DeQ5/stupid.jpg
2022-04-29 09:25:11	int-e	apparently, "mathematic" is an archaic form of "mathematical"; it's an adjective.
2022-04-29 09:25:22	Fangs	here's a stupid observation, for that "c~3" example I had, you can almost read off of the coefficients like that.. you mark two stars in that diagram, and read off of what choices you have for those blocks, sort of
2022-04-29 09:26:07	Fangs	you can take a 1xn u nx1 tableux and do that for all the "c~i"
2022-04-29 09:26:15	Fangs	so its an L shape of sort
2022-04-29 09:26:48	Fangs	but if nabla(X) = 0 and nabla(Y) = 0 then nabla(XY) = 0 too, so you can try and do the same for c~2 c~3 for example but its really messy
2022-04-29 09:26:58	int-e	Fangs: I'm confused... shouldn't the second one by (2n)(n-2) and the third one (2n)(n)?
2022-04-29 09:26:59	Fangs	multiplication of tableux is just concatentation
2022-04-29 09:27:49	Fangs	int-e: that confused me too
2022-04-29 09:27:58	Jacques	My experience with YT is only with Grobner bases
2022-04-29 09:27:58	int-e	by -> be
2022-04-29 09:28:04	Fangs	but no, it (-3n) and (3n)(2n)
2022-04-29 09:29:01	Fangs	int-e: if you try to do it with c~2 * c~3, you get a big diagram that looks like the tableux for [3,2,1,1,1]
2022-04-29 09:29:23	Fangs	and in that case, you do read off of the stars on the "[1,1,1]" section like that
2022-04-29 09:29:28	Fangs	so I'm really confused.. basically
2022-04-29 09:29:50	Fangs	been looking at these for four hours now I really need to take a break, kinda losing my mind a bit

2022-04-29 12:28:06	isekaijin	If v1, ..., vn are vectors in R^n, let's write det(v1, ..., vn) for the determinant of the matrix whose columns are v1, ..., vn.

2022-04-29 12:32:13	isekaijin	I think the text chat format doesn't help. It would be a lot clearer on mathb.in.
2022-04-29 12:32:45	leana	Ah yeah I get the alternating part now

2022-04-29 12:35:13	leana	I don't think I get that part, I don't know how one can manipulate a matrix by it's row... I can't understand how we can manipulate multiple entries of multiple vectors as a unique entity

2022-04-29 12:36:31	isekaijin	If we “plug in” a vector w in the “hole”, we get a square matrix, so we can take the determinant A(w) = det(v1, ..., v{i-1}, w, v{i+1}, ..., vn).

2022-04-29 12:38:43	leana	ah that means if you scale a row the determinant will be scaled by the same number right
2022-04-29 12:38:52	isekaijin	That's part of it.;
2022-04-29 12:38:55	isekaijin	But not all.
2022-04-29 12:39:43	isekaijin	It also means that, if two matrices M and M' only differ on the i-th row, then you can construct a matrix M'' by copying the repeated rows and adding the i-th rows, and then det(M) + det(M') = det(M'').
2022-04-29 12:40:07	leana	oh that's cool !
2022-04-29 12:40:08	isekaijin	(It only works for matrices that differ in *one* row!)
2022-04-29 12:40:15	leana	I think that answers my question then
2022-04-29 12:40:22	leana	?
2022-04-29 12:40:27	leana	I'm not so sure though
2022-04-29 12:40:53	isekaijin	You probably don't have the answer yet, but you already have the ingredients.
2022-04-29 12:40:58	isekaijin	Suppose M is your original matrix.
2022-04-29 12:41:20	isekaijin	We will construct M' by taking M and replacing the i-th row with the j-th row. (Where j is different from i.)
2022-04-29 12:41:44	isekaijin	Then M' has two repeated rows: the i-th and the j-th.
2022-04-29 12:41:49	isekaijin	So det(M') = 0.
2022-04-29 12:42:12	isekaijin	Also, M and M' only differ on the i-th row.
2022-04-29 12:42:28	isekaijin	(Because we have constructed M' by only changing M's i-th row!)
2022-04-29 12:43:07	isekaijin	Errr, the English possessive being written as an apostrophe isn't helping...
2022-04-29 12:43:12	isekaijin	(Because we have constructed M' by only changing the i-th row in M!)

2022-04-29 12:45:19	leana	I'm not so sure how to create a M''..
2022-04-29 12:45:33	isekaijin	Let's review what I said above.
2022-04-29 12:45:42	isekaijin	We have two matrices M and M', which only differ on the i-th row.\
2022-04-29 12:46:19	isekaijin	Then we construct M'' by adding the i-th rows and copying all the other rows.
2022-04-29 12:46:20	leana	yep
2022-04-29 12:46:55	leana	but what do you mean by adding the i-th row ? You add it below all rows or ?
2022-04-29 12:47:05	isekaijin	Oh, I mean vector addition.
2022-04-29 12:47:18	isekaijin	Rows are vectors, so we can add them componentwise.
2022-04-29 12:47:43	←	d3fn has quit (Quit: ZNC 1.8.2 - https://znc.in)
2022-04-29 12:48:10	isekaijin	Our original matrices are M = (v1, ..., v{i-1}, vi, v{i+1}, ..., vn) and M' = (v1, ..., v{i-1}, vi', v{i+1}, ..., vn).
2022-04-29 12:48:32	isekaijin	Notice that the only change between M and M' is that in the former, the i-th row is vi, and, in the latter, the i-th row is vi'.
2022-04-29 12:48:49	leana	Oh okay so now I have the question I raised in the beginning: Why is that adding vectors component-wize in a matrix doesn't change its determinant

2022-04-29 12:49:07	isekaijin	???
2022-04-29 12:50:17	leana	Why doesn't adding rows component-wise change the determinant ..
2022-04-29 12:50:43	leana	Cuz in a geometrical way, we are scaling the vectors of the transformation?
2022-04-29 12:50:47	isekaijin	That's still not clear. You have to specify which rows you're adding, and where you're storing the result.
2022-04-29 12:52:30	isekaijin	Okay, if you want a geometric interpretation, then the determinant of a matrix M is the volume of a parallelepiped whose sides, interpreted as vectors, are precisely the rows of M, interpreted as vectors.
2022-04-29 12:53:10	isekaijin	It's easy to visualize in the 2x2 case, where your parallelepiped is a parallelogram.

2022-04-29 19:08:40	Z-module	One of the hugest results, a Hilbert's 23 Problems problem (the 5th), is that if G is a topological group that is also a manifold, then it has a compatible atlas making it a Lie group (= smooth manifold where the product and inverse maps are smooth maps). Though probably some conditions needed that I'm forgetting.
2022-04-29 19:09:18	river	hmm this classification is very interestin: An, Bn, Cn and Dn, which have simple descriptions in terms of symmetries of Euclidean space. But there are also just five "exceptional Lie algebras" that do not fall into any of these families. E8 is the largest of these.

2022-04-29 19:20:42	Galois	I view the classification of semisimple lie algebras as one of the two major results in graduate school math. Class field theory is the other one. But whereas practically everyone learns about lie algebras, only number theorists learn about class fields.

2022-04-29 22:21:43	[itchyjunk]	so i have a R equipped with the topology {(a,inf) | a \in R}
2022-04-29 22:22:06	[itchyjunk]	it can't be a unions of of countable many compact subsets right?
2022-04-29 22:22:33	[itchyjunk]	since it's not bounded in the -inf direction , i could always find some smaller a etc?
2022-04-29 22:22:39	johnjaye	you mean like [n,inf) for n e. Z ?

2022-04-29 22:23:38	[itchyjunk]	oh right, closed intervals are compact here

2022-04-30 16:38:00	widp	and how can point on sphere be substitued by this ray?
2022-04-30 16:38:11	river	a ray is just a straight line
2022-04-30 16:39:10	river	an equation defines a set of points. to find the intersection between two shapes we can solve the equations simultaneously but substituting one into the other
2022-04-30 16:40:07	widp	oh makes sense.

2022-04-30 20:52:31	zeroc00l0	If P is a zero place predicate and Q,R are one place predicates and x is an individual term and Qx -> (P v Rx), then P v (Qx -> Rx).

2022-04-30 20:55:57	river	in a constructive logic setting you have a function f : Qx -> (P v Rx) and you cannot find out whether you have proof of P or an Rx until after you have put a proof of Qx into f

2022-04-30 22:20:42	kariosfox	hello
2022-04-30 22:21:26	surobaki	Hiya I'm relatively new to order theory and I was looking at how to algorithmically determine a maximal antichain from a poset (nontrivial). I'm working on algorithmic game theory. I found this question which discourages me as the answer claims the problem of verifying maximality is co-NP-hard. Would anyone happen to know whether there exists some "cheat method" to create a maximal antichain?(1/2)
2022-04-30 22:22:25	surobaki	The structure I'm creating an antichain for is a powerset of variables and the antichain requires incomparability with the subset or equals operator. (2/2)

2022-04-30 22:24:29	kariosfox	So I'm having problems making the area of a right triangle dependant on the hypotenuse. The right triangle is such that one of the legs and the hypotenuse add up to 10. I've tried substitution into the pythagoras theorem but the results have been unfruitful.
2022-04-30 22:26:40	kariosfox	assuming that c is the hypotenuse and a and b are  legs: a+c=10 a=10-c a^2+b^2=c^2  (10-c)^2+b^2=c^2
2022-04-30 22:27:52	kariosfox	100-20c+c^2+b^2= c^2 so b^2=20c-100

2022-04-30 22:36:13	greenbagels	the formula for the area is base * height / 2

2022-04-30 22:38:04	kariosfox	I want to calculate the derivative of this area though because I need to calculate the maximum. and I don't know integrals.

2022-04-30 22:40:17	greenbagels	so if you know the rule for polynomials, you know the rule for square roots :)
2022-04-30 22:42:16	wootehfoot	kariosfox, you can use wolframalpha for more examples: https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/calculus-and-analysis/derivatives
2022-04-30 22:42:59	buster	I'm trying to make sense of a footnote, "Of course the function f ↦ f(x) is not continuous in the L² norm, i.e., there does not exist a number C such that |f(x)| ≤ C‖f‖₂ for all f∈S." (S being the domain of the function f↦f(x), namely the set of test functions or Schwartz functions.) I can see why the right hand side of the "i.e." is true, but not why it
2022-04-30 22:42:59	buster	means that f ↦ f(x) is continuous.
2022-04-30 22:43:31	isekaijin	greenbagels: You'd have to prove that the same rule works for fractional exponents...

2022-04-30 22:52:39	greenbagels	kariosfox: the rule for the derivative of monomials is d/dx x^n = n * x^(n-1)
2022-04-30 22:53:01	greenbagels	it is a separate result that this rule also works for noninteger values of n

2022-04-30 22:56:58	isekaijin	The only rules that really matter are (A) derivatives of constants: dc = 0, (B) additivity: d(f + g) = df + dg, (C) the Leibniz rule: d(fg) = g df + f dg, (D) derivatives of logarithms: d(log x) = (1/x) dx, and (E) the chain rule: d(f(x)) = f'(x) dx... Oh, and the fact that e^x is the inverse function of log(x).
2022-04-30 22:57:42	isekaijin	I love how the chain rule is just d(f(x)) = f'(x) dx, without mentioning any second function...

2022-05-01 01:27:20	csGraduate	Mathematics is therefore the study of any and all certain truths about any concept (i.e. about numbers, or about symbols, images, sounds, video - almost anything).

2022-05-01 01:35:08	isekaijin	Rigor is, of course, absolutely indispensable.
2022-05-01 01:35:15	isekaijin	But do we have to stick to a formal syntax for that?
2022-05-01 01:35:21	csGraduate	Formalim is a philosophy which identifies Mathematics as an instrument composed of a set of rules, and aiding in solving real-world problems.
2022-05-01 01:35:42	isekaijin	We can reason rigorously about geometric, combinatorial, etc. whatever objects, both and without using a formal language.
2022-05-01 01:35:57	isekaijin	Sometimes a formal language helps, but sometimes it also gets in the way.
2022-05-01 01:37:14	isekaijin	In any case, the study formal languages as mathematical objects in their own right is logic. Of course, logic is a part of mathematics, but it's not *all* of mathematics.

2022-05-01 11:14:01	isekaijin	So divide n/d and round the real and imaginary parts. Either upward or downard is fine for both parts.
2022-05-01 11:14:15	isekaijin	Mmm, wait.
2022-05-01 11:14:22	isekaijin	Maybe you need to round to the nearest one.
2022-05-01 11:14:27	isekaijin	Yeah, to the nearest one.
2022-05-01 11:14:38	isekaijin	So, take n/d = x + iy, and round x, y to the nearest integer.
2022-05-01 11:14:42	isekaijin	So far so good?
2022-05-01 11:15:17	isekaijin	Then q = round(x) + i round(y) is less than 1 far away from n/d.
2022-05-01 11:15:40	isekaijin	(Because round(x) and round(y) are individually less than 1/2 far away from x and y, respectively.)

2022-05-01 11:21:49	isekaijin	But the point is that, if you take n/d, then the nearest Gaussian integer is less than 1 away.
2022-05-01 11:22:06	isekaijin	In fact, at most 1/sqrt(2) away.
2022-05-01 11:22:41	Fangs	if x is norm-minimal element in an ideal, and y is some elements not on the lattice (not in (x)), then y = xq+r where N(r) < N(x) by your proposition

Some

2022-05-02 19:40:04	neiluj	In fact the product can be rewritten as P(x)*(x-w)=- a_0 * w + sum_(i=1)^n (a_(i-1)-a_i w) x^i + a_n x^(n+1)
2022-05-02 19:40:38	neiluj	from this we clearly see that the constant term is prod_i w^(2048 i) and a_n=1

2022-05-02 19:41:38	neiluj	so the sum in the middle must be 0, so maybe the sum covers all elements of the prime field to be equal to 0, but unfortunately I don't think so because p > 2^16

2022-05-02 20:03:58	int-e	Hmm. I'm still working backwards: Let r = w^2048. We have (x-1)(x-r)...(x-r^31) = x^32 - c for some c. This implies c = 1 (because 1 is a root), r^(31*16) = -1 (to make the constant term match), and (1+r)(1+r^2)(1+r^4)(1+r^8)(1+r^16) = 0 (to make the x^31 term match)... so r = -1 or r^2 = -1 or ... or r^16 = -1. Only r^16 = -1 is compatible with r^(31*16) = -1. So r must be a primitive 32nd root in...
2022-05-02 20:04:04	int-e	...your field.
2022-05-02 20:04:24	int-e	And w must be a primitive 65536th root in your field. So... n = 16 indeed.

2022-05-02 20:15:20	neiluj	sorry still trying to catch up with the discussion, but to show the equality  Prod_(i=0)^(n/2048-1) (X-(w^2048 i)) = X^(n/2048) + Prod_(i=0)^(n/2048-1) w^(2048 i) one can show that the right-hand side has roots (w^2048 i)_i
2022-05-02 20:15:21	int-e	Ah, instead of factoring (1+r)(1+r^2)(1+r^4)(1+r^8)(1+r^16), I should multiply the sum by (r-1) to get r^32 = 1. Which, together with r^(31*16) = -1, gives the desired r^16 = -1.
2022-05-02 20:16:08	int-e	neiluj: The trouble is that as you initially described it, there were two n related by n = 2^n.
2022-05-02 20:16:16	int-e	That's the main source of the confusion.
2022-05-02 20:16:19	neiluj	oh

2022-05-02 20:24:07	int-e	+primitive
2022-05-02 20:24:25	neiluj	huh, we don't need the r^i to form a subgroup, right?
2022-05-02 20:24:59	int-e	well, it turns out that we do need that... otherwise things don't cancel out this way.
2022-05-02 20:25:00	neiluj	because then i consider translated sets of the w^j {r^i}_i
2022-05-02 20:25:23	neiluj	and it turns out that the equality also holds for these sets of roots
2022-05-02 20:25:51	int-e	neiluj: that's ruled out because (x-1) is a factor

2022-05-02 22:38:22	→	EvilDMP has joined ##math
2022-05-02 22:38:45	laurus	I'm trying to use the terminology that most people use when talking about this, but I confuse myself because this book flips the terms around
2022-05-02 22:39:13	laurus	Right, I agree, a finite subset of R or C does not have a limit point
2022-05-02 22:39:22	laurus	But it does have adherent points, correct?
2022-05-02 22:40:38	Z-module	It's nearly universal that if X is a topological space and A is some subset of X, then a "limit point" (also called "accumulation point") of A is some x in X so that every open set containing x also contains a point of A\{x}.  The term "adherent point" has sometimes been used for this meaning, but is more often a thing about sequences.
2022-05-02 22:40:54	Z-module	I don't think there's really any standard meaning for "adherent point"
2022-05-02 22:41:41	laurus	Z-module: Right, my book uses a different definition for "limit point" so sometimes I get confused. But anyway
2022-05-02 22:42:24	Z-module	I think I remember that your book counts all points of A as limit points of A. WHich is *quite* nonstandard.
2022-05-02 22:43:21	laurus	Z-module: Heh, yeah, you remember well, I appreciate that :) This book uses the words "cluster point" to mean what most people call "limit point". It uses the term "limit point" to mean what most people call "adherent point". So when I talk about this I try to make that mental switch but I sometimes confuse myself
2022-05-02 22:43:56	Z-module	You could get around the finiteness problem this way:  A sequence (x_n) of reals converges to a limit y   iff   the point set {(1/n, x_n) : n=1,2,3,...} in R^2 has the point (0, y) as a topological limit point.
2022-05-02 22:44:42	laurus	So I guess what I'm asking is, if I try to take the definition of "x_n in A converges to u in M" and connect it to concepts of open balls, as well as potentially concepts of "limit point" and "adherent point", is that appropriate to do? I know it can be reworded in terms of open balls as I mentioned above, but does that in turn relate to one of the two "limit point" or "adherent point" concepts?
2022-05-02 22:47:04	Z-module	Wikipedia thinks an "adherent point" of a subset A of a top. space is your book's limit point:  any point of A, or any (standard definition) limit point of A.
2022-05-02 22:47:11	laurus	That's right.
2022-05-02 22:47:14	Z-module	I'm not too sure this is that widely used as a definition, thouigh.
2022-05-02 22:47:27	laurus	I see.
2022-05-02 22:48:23	laurus	It seems to me that there exists x_n in A converging to u in M if and only if u is an adherent point of A.
2022-05-02 22:48:53	Z-module	That's right.
2022-05-02 22:49:37	laurus	Gosh, now I think I see why Goldberg flipped the terms. He probably did that so "the limit of x_n in A equals u" means "u is a limit point of A".
2022-05-02 22:49:53	laurus	Whereas the way most people talk about it, you'd have to say "the limti of x_n in A equals u if and only if u is an adherent point of A"
2022-05-02 22:51:31	laurus	Z-module: I think this answered my questions, thank you for helping me think through this.

2022-05-02 22:54:44	xiaguan	ok guys i have one for you
2022-05-02 22:54:51	xiaguan	i have this regression problem
2022-05-02 22:54:57	xiaguan	X = B Z
2022-05-02 22:55:08	xiaguan	X is an observed time series
2022-05-02 22:55:11	xiaguan	Z is our latent model
2022-05-02 22:55:33	xiaguan	B is the loading matrix.
2022-05-02 22:56:03	→	dez_ has joined ##math
2022-05-02 22:56:15	xiaguan	this is fine. i can use linear algebra to perform the linear regression and get a "good" B to approximate X
2022-05-02 22:56:27	xiaguan	now i have two related processes
2022-05-02 22:56:42	xiaguan	X1 = B Z1 and X2 = B Z2
2022-05-02 22:57:00	xiaguan	B should be the same matrix in both expressions
2022-05-02 22:57:27	xiaguan	am i able to do some clever linear algebra trick to solve for B?

2022-05-03 19:40:49	Simplar	Please guide me on the right tracks. I've got a function f(x)=(sqrt(a) - 2cos(x) + 1)/((sin(x))^2 + a + 2sqrt(a) + 1). I need to find the values of a parameter a that make it true that values that this function can output will include range [2;3] (from 2 to 3 inclusive), i.e. E(f) must include 2, 3, and everything between them, and allows for other possible values as long as E(f) includes that interval
2022-05-03 19:41:19	Simplar	I understand that for that to be possible numerator should be twice (and thrice) more than denominator at least
2022-05-03 19:42:30	Simplar	I also discovered by assumption that a=0 satisfies the condition
2022-05-03 19:42:40	Simplar	But I'm not sure if a=0 is the only value

2022-05-03 19:46:04	Simplar	That's when cos(x)=-1 of course
2022-05-03 19:46:13	Simplar	that's where sin(x) is equal to 0, too
2022-05-03 19:46:14	←	gxt has quit (Remote host closed the connection)

2022-05-03 19:46:36	→	gxt has joined ##math
2022-05-03 19:46:57	Simplar	we know that the cos(x) and sin(x) functions are all continuous, so if a function takes two values it will also take all the values between them

2022-05-03 23:56:59	Jacques	Let R(x) = x^T A x / x^T x. Consider the SVD of A: A = UDV*, where D is the diagonal matrix of singular values and both U,V are unitary (orthogonal in the real case like here). Take the 2-norm (||.||) of R(x):
2022-05-03 23:57:00	Jacques	||x^T A x / x^T x|| = ||x^T U D V^T x||/ ||x^T x||
2022-05-03 23:57:00	Jacques	Recall for any two dimension compatible) matrices: ||A B|| <= ||A|| ||B||
2022-05-03 23:57:01	Jacques	Utilizing this inequality we obtain:
2022-05-03 23:57:01	Jacques	||x^T U D V^T x|| / ||x^T x|| <= ||x^T|| ||U D V^T x|| / ||x^T|| || x||  = ||x^T|| ||D V^T x|| // ||x^T|| ||x||
2022-05-03 23:57:02	Jacques	Recall, for any diagonal D, ||D|| <= maximum{d_{ii}} := d_max
2022-05-03 23:57:02	Jacques	Then, ||x^T|| ||D V^T x|| // ||x^T|| ||x||  <= ||x^T|| sigma_max ||V^T x|| / ||x^T|| ||x|| = ||x^T|| sigma_max ||x|| / ||x^T|| ||x|| = sigma_max.
2022-05-03 23:57:03	Jacques	Thus,
2022-05-03 23:57:03	Jacques	||R(x)|| <= sigma_max
2022-05-03 23:57:15	Jacques	Apologies, this is probably hard to follow in text format
2022-05-03 23:58:06	Jacques	But, Batzy, the above takes the norm of the rayleigh quotient (the R(x)) and does the same process as my original proof. Though this time we start with R(x) which is probably what the exercise desires
2022-05-03 23:58:20	←	LiftLeft has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2022-05-03 23:58:52	Jacques	and to answer your question, yes.
2022-05-03 23:59:41	Jacques	The crux of the above proof is the utilization of: ||D|| <= d_max
2022-05-04 00:00:06	Jacques	is the opposite true? ||D|| >= d_min. If so, can I simply repeat the proof but instead use this inequality?
2022-05-04 00:00:28	Batzy	well how do you define ||D||

2022-05-04 00:04:57	Jacques	The definition of the induced matrix 2-norm is: ||A|| = max_{||x|| != 0| ||Ax||/||x||_2 = max_{||x||_2 = 1} ||Ax||, but I do not know how to arrive at the inequality
2022-05-04 00:07:01	Batzy	well the definition should be sup ||Ax||_2  such that ||x||_2 = 1

2022-05-04 00:19:26	Z-module	Yeah, let me make it more readable by using [.] instead of ||.|| :   For nonzero x, let v mean x/[x].  Then  [Ax] / [x] = [A [x]v] / [x] = [x] [Av]/[x] = [Av].  So it suffices to just consider all v = x/[x]  where x is nonzero. For each such v,   [v] = [(1/[x]) x] = (1/[x]) [x] = 1.

2022-05-04 00:33:53	Z-module	So I'll step back.  The two two sets of *vectors*   { Av/[v] : nonzero vectors v },  { Aw : vectors w with [w] =  1 }   are identical sets. Thus the set of all the norms of things in those are the same two sets of nonnegative reals. So these two have the same sup.

2022-05-07 00:28:12	jodmos	sure. me too. he was a teacher of mine at one point, so I have some insight about what it's about, though.
2022-05-07 00:28:35	Jacques	wow really really?
2022-05-07 00:28:40	jodmos	homology applied to sheaves of modules endowed with differential operators.
2022-05-07 00:28:55	Jacques	uhm
2022-05-07 00:29:14	jodmos	a natural construct to study for differential equations, in fact.
2022-05-07 00:29:21	jodmos	but not my cup of tea.
2022-05-07 00:29:24	Jacques	Okay, my knowledge is from Ideals, Varieties, and Algorithms by Cox etc

2022-05-07 00:30:38	jodmos	Grobner is about ideals. Ideals are modules. Sheaves of modules are generalised modules.

2022-05-07 00:35:34	Jacques	Now how is what you said about "function field endowed with a differential operator" related to that
2022-05-07 00:35:58	ℹ	Guest6593 is now known as Polo
2022-05-07 00:36:16	joel135	Jacques: maybe the book "Gröbner Bases and Applications" by Buchberger and Winkler has something about PDEs. i wasn't able to download it from libgen though
2022-05-07 00:36:30	Jacques	Okay, I will attempt at finding it
2022-05-07 00:36:47	Jacques	Buchberger created Buchbergers algorithm for generating Grobner basis elements
2022-05-07 00:36:50	jodmos	well, if you got a manifold, you can always consider the functions defined on it. it's a ring. it's moreover endowed with partial differential operators.
2022-05-07 00:37:11	Jacques	I only loosely know what a manifold is
2022-05-07 00:37:24	jodmos	locally, if the manifold is an affine space, it looks neat: a ring with differential operators.
2022-05-07 00:37:56	jodmos	then you've got the point as maximal ideals approach, and you can carry out the approach of algebraic geometry.
2022-05-07 00:38:05	jodmos	with differential operators on top.
2022-05-07 00:38:23	jodmos	which are endomorphisms of that ring.
2022-05-07 00:38:29	jodmos	roughly.

2022-05-07 00:42:45	jodmos	d: k[X] -> k[X]
2022-05-07 00:42:58	Jacques	is k an arbitrary field?
2022-05-07 00:43:02	←	[-_-] has quit (Quit: ZZZzzz?)
2022-05-07 00:43:09	jodmos	operator on the ring k[X]. linear. behaves differently with respect to multiplication.
2022-05-07 00:43:24	jodmos	d(PQ) = (dP)Q + P(dQ)
2022-05-07 00:43:38	jodmos	But spec(k[X]) is a line.
2022-05-07 00:44:05	jodmos	so you've got a ring, k[X], endowed with the derivation on top of it.
2022-05-07 00:44:07	Jacques	you mean spectrum? that is a prime ideals thing right?
2022-05-07 00:44:11	jodmos	yep
2022-05-07 00:44:23	Jacques	why do you care that the spectrum "is a line" whatever that means
2022-05-07 00:44:37	jodmos	you asked for unidimensional example.

2022-05-07 00:45:13	jodmos	k[X] is a ring. Spec(k[X]) is the affine line. k(X) is the function field of that line.
2022-05-07 00:45:22	Jacques	alright..
2022-05-07 00:46:04	jodmos	And differentiation operates on k[X].

2022-05-07 00:46:44	energizer	concatenation (cat a b) = ab is associative but not commutative. somehow it feels very symmetric even though it's not commutative. is that just because it's associative, or is there more symmetry going on?
2022-05-07 00:46:47	Jacques	Do you have a reference for all of this? In addition to "Gröbner Bases and Applications" ?

2022-05-07 00:47:20	jodmos	that's your "symmetry".
2022-05-07 00:47:40	jodmos	Jacques nope. stoped studying this 15 years ago. I'm rusty.

2022-05-07 00:48:46	jodmos	M monoid of strings endowed with concatenation. Reversal of strings is M -> M. (ab)°=b°a°. Contravariant. a°°=a. Involutive.
2022-05-07 00:49:03	jodmos	energizer that's your "symmetry".
2022-05-07 00:49:51	Jacques	you don't happen to have lecture notes do you >.>
2022-05-07 00:50:27	jodmos	nope. everything are memories.
2022-05-07 00:50:29	energizer	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Involution_(mathematics) says an involution is a funciton f such that forall x, f(f(x)) = x. how does that apply to a 2-ary function like cat?
2022-05-07 00:50:37	jodmos	I may have some Shapira stuff somewhere, though...
2022-05-07 00:51:03	jodmos	energizer reversal of the reversal of a string is the string itself. That's involutive.
2022-05-07 00:51:20	Jacques	Maybe when I obtain more defined questions I will continue this line of questions with you
2022-05-07 00:51:23	Jacques	thank you for the discussion though
2022-05-07 00:51:30	jodmos	you're welcome.
2022-05-07 00:51:37	energizer	jodmos: but i was asking about concat not reverse
2022-05-07 00:51:52	jodmos	concat is the operation of your monoid.
2022-05-07 00:52:04	jodmos	reverse is the hidden "symmetry" of that monoid.
2022-05-07 00:53:51	energizer	ok, now what about the "contravariant" part
2022-05-07 00:54:34	jodmos	contravariant meanse (ab)°=b°a°. reverse of the concatenation of a and b is the concatenation of the reverse of b and the reverse of a.
2022-05-07 00:54:42	jodmos	covariant would be (ab)°=a°b°.
2022-05-07 00:54:53	jodmos	Here, it's contravariant.
2022-05-07 00:55:20	Jacques	how about more general question
2022-05-07 00:55:21	Jacques	can we talk about PDEs with algebra?
2022-05-07 00:55:43	Jacques	so ignoring the desire for algebraic geometry
2022-05-07 00:55:43	jodmos	yep. which is why Shapira calls his field of enquiry "algebraic analysis".
2022-05-07 00:56:20	energizer	and "canonical"?
2022-05-07 00:56:38	jodmos	it's not algebraic geometry. sheaf theory grew out of such PDE stuff. With Leray. It's only incidentally that Grothendieck and Serre noticed it was a boon for algebraic geometry.
2022-05-07 00:56:56	joel135	Jacques: i found a working mirror http://library.lol/main/b21a0740c303e148388f9d669478b0ec . the article starting at page 221 is about linear homogeneous PDEs. the article starting at page 235 is also about PDEs and it does mention sheaves just like jodmos. page 246 has connections between gröbner bases, hypergeometric functions and PDEs. i didn't find any other articles in this book. all deal with linear PDEs only.
2022-05-07 00:57:07	Jacques	woah
2022-05-07 00:57:10	jodmos	energizer something is canonical when there is a way to get it that is utterly unambiguous.

2022-05-07 23:44:36	johnkeats6	buster, you might enjoy looking at Wald's Advanced Classical Electromagnetism. finally a no-nonsense EM book. the first (quick) chapter 'EM Theory without Myths' is particularly nice
2022-05-07 23:44:39	parsnip	not sure if my following question fits here, but looking for some precise language

2022-05-07 23:46:06	parsnip	you can change the height of the pin, by moving up or down seat post, possible removing back reflector
2022-05-07 23:46:23	→	Hanii has joined ##math
2022-05-07 23:46:45	parsnip	now you bring in trailer. it has two wheels like a hand cart. the "handle" attaches to the pin on the seat post
2022-05-07 23:47:15	parsnip	if you are on a flat surface (not necessarily parallel to earth),
2022-05-07 23:47:29	parsnip	you can line things up so the pin drops in nicely
2022-05-07 23:47:47	greenbagels	biberao: ok i just translated the image; so remember that with a plane wiht equation ax + by + cz = d has a normal vector (a,b,c)
2022-05-07 23:47:52	parsnip	but now there seems to be a danger, if you lift either of bike's wheels
2022-05-07 23:47:56	biberao	greenbagels: reta=line

2022-05-07 23:48:33	biberao	greenbagels: to prove the line is parallel i need to have a perpendicular vector

2022-05-07 23:48:58	parsnip	i guess lifting either of two wheels simulates riding to where two flat surfaces meet, or going into a cylinder

2022-05-07 23:49:54	Guest55	Hello everyone, quick question. Should the fourier transform of an even function have phase=0?
2022-05-07 23:49:54	Guest55	A real and even x(t) transforms into a real and even X(Ω), so arctan(Im/Re)=0 since Im=0.
2022-05-07 23:49:55	Guest55	But the fourier transform of the rectangular function does have a phase != 0.
2022-05-07 23:49:58	parsnip	and there are youtube videos of parts of trailer breaking, especially handle breaking
2022-05-07 23:50:18	parsnip	i guess thinking out loud, i've got the best description i can think of
2022-05-07 23:50:26	greenbagels	biberao: you have to figure that out from the two equations they gave you at the start
2022-05-07 23:50:37	biberao	greenbagels: i got that
2022-05-07 23:50:45	biberao	ok let me reask

2022-05-07 23:52:12	greenbagels	ok no biberao think of it like this
2022-05-07 23:52:28	greenbagels	you know for your line, y=-2 for every point on the line
2022-05-07 23:52:37	greenbagels	so you know every point will look like (x, -2, z) on that line
2022-05-07 23:53:10	greenbagels	the first equation they gave you provides a way to turn a given x value into a z value for that line, and vice versa

2022-05-07 23:56:42	biberao	:D
2022-05-07 23:58:25	greenbagels	ok so a parameterization for the line would be ( t, -2, [-2t+2]/-6 ); basically if we write this as u + v*t, you want the v part
2022-05-07 23:59:03	greenbagels	so this would be (t, -2, t/3 - 1/3), aka (1, 0, 1/3)t + (0, -2, -3)
2022-05-07 23:59:40	greenbagels	so (1, 0, 1/3) is a tangent vector for the line biberao
2022-05-08 00:00:38	biberao	you mean for (-2x+2)/3=-2z and y=-2

2022-05-08 18:12:32	aydio	Probably, I'm not very familiar with math terminology. Z-module, that's what I was thinking. I was wondering if I am allowed to infer that from the given information. It's German, so I'll try again: "We assume that X_1,...X_n are independent and equally distributed on [0,1) which leads to random occupation of M_1,...,M_k. Determine the distribution of M_1. Are M_1 and M_2 independent?". The question
2022-05-08 18:12:34	aydio	is asked in the context of bucket sort, whereby each X_i is multiplied by some natural k and rounded down, yielding the bucket number. E.g. floor(5*0.5) = 2 for k = 5 buckets and X_i = 0.5
2022-05-08 18:12:55	river	what's M?

2022-05-08 18:18:53	aydio	M_i is the i-th bucket, i.e. it contains all X [0,1) that, when multiplied with k (natural) and then floored, yield i. E.g. k = 5 buckets, X = 0.5. floor(k*X) = 2. M_2 therefore contains X. Again sorry, I am not good at translating this german text
2022-05-08 18:19:15	river	oh so M_i is random variable representing an integer, the count of things inside this bucket
2022-05-08 18:19:41	river	I think that there can be dependency between M's

2022-05-08 20:04:30	Z-module	oh, well, say you have a real-valued function f(x,y,z) of three variables.  At any given (x,y,z) in R^3, the (let's say) partial of f w.r.t. y, denoted  \partial f/\partial y   or   f_y   or   f_2 , is defined as   lim_{h -> 0}  (f(x, y+h, z) - f(x,y,z))/h
2022-05-08 20:05:45	Z-module	So if you have f as some closed-form formula, such as  e^x sin(yz) - z^3  or whatever, to take d/dy of that (meaning \partial f / \partial y) generically, you just use familiar differentiation rules, wher y is the variable, and treating x and z as if they are constants. So  d/dy z = d/dy x = 0
2022-05-08 20:06:51	Z-module	So d/dy [e^x sin(yz) - z^3] =  z e^x cos(yz)      since the e^x is a constant (it does not vary at all when y varies), similarly for z

2022-05-08 22:41:14	Z-module	Because on each payment date, they are charging all of  I = (the fixed rate)(the currently unpaid balance), and then reducing the unpaid balance by some varying amount B such that  I + B   remains constant all throughout the loan.

2022-05-08 22:43:51	Z-module	In other words, I and B are each functions of n = # of months in the whole loan (usually either 30*12 or 15*12). For each month n,   I(n) = interest owed on    (initial loan) - (sum of B(m) for all m < n  = all principal paid off so far), and then B(n) is some varying number such that I(n) + B(n) is constant for all n.

2022-05-08 22:45:31	Z-module	If you naively had set  B(n) = (initial loan)/(# of months in loan)  for every month n, the early payments would be waaay bigger than the later ones, as the interest you owe slowly goes down. So instead they shift around those B(n)  numbers to balance it all out.

2022-05-09 15:26:19	Smilex	I think the derivate is either (\partial f)/(\partial x \partial y) or (\partial f)/(\partial y \partial x)
2022-05-09 15:26:24	Fangs	Smilex: well just very naively right, you can just differentiate wrt to both variables, you get df/dx and df/fy

2022-05-09 15:27:46	Fangs	Smilex: (\partial^2 f)/(\partial x \partial y) is part of the second derivative
2022-05-09 15:28:19	Smilex	ah right
2022-05-09 15:28:29	Fangs	Smilex: so the naive thing to do is to just form a 'vector' (df/dx,df/dy)
2022-05-09 15:28:50	Fangs	Smilex: do they give you the formal definition of these partial derivatives btw?
2022-05-09 15:29:01	Fangs	are you comfortable with epsilon-delta?

2022-05-09 15:32:03	Fangs	ill keep it informal then
2022-05-09 15:32:20	Fangs	Smilex: if f were a single variabl function f: R -> R say, then what does the derivative tell you about the function?
2022-05-09 15:32:38	Fangs	might be related to the graph of the function and something something slope or something
2022-05-09 15:32:44	Smilex	it's growth I guess?

2022-05-09 15:33:28	Fangs	when is a function's derivative positive/negative?
2022-05-09 15:34:01	Smilex	positive when the graph is increasing, and negative when it's decreasing. zero at an extremum
2022-05-09 15:36:28	←	jmdaemon has quit (Ping timeout: 248 seconds)
2022-05-09 15:39:07	Fangs	right
2022-05-09 15:39:58	Fangs	Smilex: in the real number line going to the right you get more positive and going to the left you get more negative
2022-05-09 15:40:22	Fangs	Smilex: so when the function is increasing to the right i.e. sloped "/", the derivative is positive and hence pointing to the right
2022-05-09 15:40:48	Fangs	Smilex: when the function is increasing to the left i.e. sloped "\", the derivative is negative and hence pointing to the left
2022-05-09 15:41:41	Fangs	if you have a function that looks like "f: R^n -> R", the the vector consisting of the partial derivatives of f is going to point wherever the function is increasing the fastest

2022-05-09 16:32:30	Fangs	your vector is a function of two variables v(x,y) = [ -(x/sqrt(-x^2 - y^2 + 1)), -(y/sqrt(-x^2 - y^2 + 1))]

2022-05-09 17:08:46	Fangs	Smilex: so another property of derivatives is that you can 'approximate' the value of the function near a particular point, just by the derivative

2022-05-09 23:25:35	kariosfox	hello there. I'm having trouble converting an exponent. the equation is  12^a=18. I know roughly what I need to do but, I just don't know if I'm doing it right.
2022-05-09 23:25:59	Z-module	kariosfox: do you know the formula for log to an arbitrary base? In this case, base 12
2022-05-09 23:26:46	Z-module	Namely:  If log_12 means log base 12, and ln is natural log:   a = log_12(18) = ln(18)/ln(12)
2022-05-09 23:27:51	kariosfox	well I haven't had natural log yet.
2022-05-09 23:27:53	←	qwedfg has quit (Quit: ZNC - https://znc.in)
2022-05-09 23:28:00	Z-module	Have you had base-10 log?
2022-05-09 23:28:14	Z-module	It's the same: if log means base-10 log, then  a = log(18)/log(12)
2022-05-09 23:28:38	Z-module	any base at all (positive and not 1) will work
2022-05-09 23:29:06	Z-module	But without *some* sort of logarithm, you can't do this problem
2022-05-09 23:29:26	kariosfox	well yeah I know

2022-05-09 23:37:40	Z-module	right
2022-05-09 23:38:03	kariosfox	I mean I guess you could divide out the 6 but you still get different bases.
2022-05-09 23:38:32	kariosfox	like (2^2*3)^a=(2*3^2)
2022-05-09 23:38:50	Z-module	a isn't an integer, so it's no help
2022-05-09 23:38:55	→	bliminse has joined ##math
2022-05-09 23:38:57	kariosfox	yeah
2022-05-09 23:39:23	kariosfox	well it can't be an integer
2022-05-09 23:40:29	Z-module	 ln(18)/ln(12) = (ln(2) + ln(3) + ln(3))/(ln(2) + ln(2) + ln(3))   but that doesn't help anything.
2022-05-09 23:41:15	Z-module	Anyway,  ln(18)/ln(12)  is a perfectly reasonable expression, and this exactly what a is.
2022-05-09 23:41:22	kariosfox	well I don't know natural logs.

2022-05-09 23:45:24	Z-module	Hi Jacques
2022-05-09 23:46:07	kariosfox	I know base 10 exists but I can't calculate it's value unless it's a power of ten.
2022-05-09 23:46:17	→	loadedanvils has joined ##math
2022-05-09 23:47:36	Z-module	There are infinite series ways, etc. Or use software for it.
2022-05-09 23:47:47	Z-module	You're not going to calculate an approximation by hand.
2022-05-09 23:47:54	Z-module	(of if you are, it's very sad)
2022-05-09 23:48:39	kariosfox	I mean it's an exam question, I only would have a simple calc to hand.
2022-05-09 23:49:05	Z-module	Either they want  ln(18)/ln(12)  as the exact answer, *or* they want you to use a calculator to get an approximate numeric answer.
2022-05-09 23:49:35	Z-module	Nearly every calculator that has log_10 also has ln, by the way.
2022-05-09 23:49:54	Z-module	but you can use either
2022-05-09 23:50:47	Z-module	You can't give an exact numeric answer: it's irrational.
2022-05-09 23:51:03	kariosfox	well we aren't allowed to have a calc which has those.
2022-05-09 23:51:24	Z-module	Cripe
2022-05-09 23:51:25	stanrifkin	gauss would have calculated that in his head
2022-05-09 23:51:39	Z-module	Are you sure they want a numeric answer?
2022-05-09 23:53:07	kariosfox	well they want proof that based on 12^a=18 log base9 of 4 = (2-a)/2a-1). I can't see solving that without knowing a.
2022-05-09 23:53:53	→	magla has joined ##math
2022-05-09 23:54:38	Z-module	You should have said that from the beginning. This does NOT require any numeric knowledge of a
2022-05-09 23:56:39	kariosfox	Well I assumed it did. We still have 9 to the power of (2-a)/(2a-1) =4. both equations have different bases.
2022-05-09 23:59:47	←	mbuf has quit (Quit: Leaving)
2022-05-09 23:59:59	kariosfox	I can't just equate the exponents since the bases are different. and even if we did as I said  we would get 2^a=3
2022-05-10 00:00:22	stanrifkin	can you write that more clean?
2022-05-10 00:00:37	kariosfox	as in latex?
2022-05-10 00:00:58	Z-module	If  (2 - a)/(2a - 1) = log_9(4), then  9^((2 - a)/(2a - 1)) = (9^(2 - a))^(1/(2a - 1)) = 4,  so  9^(2 - a) = 4^(2a - 1)  so  4*3^(4 - 2a) = (4^a)^2 so  4^a = 2*3^(2 - a)  so  12^a = 3^a 4^a = 2*3^(2 - a + a) = 18.  Done.
2022-05-10 00:01:33	Z-module	That's a fairly tricky problem at this level of math.

2022-05-10 00:07:08	kariosfox	Z-module, wait why did you divide by the denominator of the exponent? is that even allowed?
2022-05-10 00:08:04	Z-module	I only used   a^(b/c) = [a^b]^(1/c)
2022-05-10 00:08:18	Z-module	a special case of   x^(yz) = (x^y)^z
2022-05-10 00:09:17	Z-module	my  9^((2 - a)/(2a - 1))  there is  9^(b/c)  where b = 2 - a,  c = 2a - 1
2022-05-10 00:09:51	Z-module	and  9^(b/c) = 4  means  9^b = 4^c

2022-06-12 19:07:49	int-e	Fangs: well, factoring p^n - 1 isn't polynomial.

2022-06-12 19:08:40	ptolemy	int-e: what about generating random polynomials and testing for primitivity.  Once you find one you've identified a generator.

2022-06-12 19:09:11	Fangs	taeaad: taeaad: for F_(p^k), you'll always have a "mod p" for the 'coefficients'
2022-06-12 19:09:17	int-e	ptolemy: what's the difference?
2022-06-12 19:09:17	ptolemy	Oh wait, I think testing for primitivity also involves factoring.
2022-06-12 19:09:48	int-e	you can check irreducibility in polynomial time, but primitivity? I think that's doing the same order test, ultimately.
2022-06-12 19:10:03	ptolemy	yes, I think you're right.
2022-06-12 19:10:47	Fangs	taeaad: I think its safe to say that in practive people will always give F_(p^n) as some vector space over F_p.. like in int-e 's example for F_27, you have x+yj+z j^2, such that j^2 - j - 1 = 0 (mod 3)

2022-06-12 19:14:43	taeaad	Alright. So one confusing thing then: 3 mod 3 = 0 in F_27. So how are we supposed to generate its powers? In Z/26Z we just do 3 + 3 mod 26.
2022-06-12 19:15:13	Fangs	taeaad: powers of 0 is still 0.. so powers of p are still zero in F_(p^n)

2022-06-12 19:49:54	Z-module	Yeah, a quadratic like x^2 + 1 can only have 2 roots (at most) in any field. Uncountably many in the quaternions. Commutativity of multiplication makes all the difference.
2022-06-12 19:49:54	Fangs	start with i and let S^3 the group of unit quartenions act on i by conjugation, and this should give a map S^3 -> S^2 with fibers the circle crossing {1,i,-i,-1}

2022-06-12 19:51:28	Z-module	A *few* things carry over from fields to H, at least.  (H being the real quaternions.) In a field, every finite multiplicative subgroup is cyclic. In H, that's not always true, but it is for odd-order subgroups. So strange.

2022-06-12 19:52:06	taeaad	Fangs: If it's related to the Hopf fibration, must be nice enough to make an artwork out of...
2022-06-12 19:52:41	Pollion	You can find such things in old Bourbaki books, where they were called "corps gauches" (Left field), but now everybody only use field for a commutative division ring to avoid confusions.

2022-06-12 22:23:21	isekaijin	We don't really talk about whether a transcendental extension is solvable or not.

2022-06-12 22:23:46	isekaijin	If every algebraic extension of F_p is solvable, then you need to consider a different base field to find non-solvable extensions.
2022-06-12 22:24:06	taeaad	Right, because you are formally adding a symbol that will result in linear combinations of it.
2022-06-12 22:24:23	isekaijin	?

2022-06-12 22:25:21	taeaad	If you add some trancendental number t to a finite field, you will get linear combinations in a polynomial ring. Then if you want it to be a field you get the field of fractions.

2022-06-13 00:15:17	taeaad	pounce: I think that one should be careful with describing groups as "just isomorphic" since they could be subgroups of a bigger group in different places. When you look at subobjects some of them can be isomorphic but they are different elements in the lattice. And when you construct them explcitly, e.g. as permutation group subgroups, they make "look" different. For example you can construct the Klein 4 group as a subgroup of S_4
2022-06-13 00:15:17	taeaad	either as identity with 3 double transpositions, or as identity with two single transpositions and one double transposition.

2022-06-13 00:16:21	taeaad	I was reading an old book from the 1930s by Diehn where he was pointing this latter example out. But to be fair, in general I am one of those careless "algebraists". So careless that I don't even know much about finite fields.

2022-06-13 00:25:23	isekaijin	So, to say that two subgroups f : H -> G and f' : H' -> G' are isomorphic means to (be able to) construct the obvious commuting square.

2022-06-13 00:27:32	taeaad	The other two interesting aspect to me of isomorphism vs. equality is nontrivial results from skeleton categories vs. original category (like in Categories, Allegories) and quotient categories (I think Barr has a book about that). But the former IIRC is mostly about largeness (i.e. isomorphism classes that are not sets).
2022-06-13 00:28:05	isekaijin	pounce: What a coincidence, neither do I!
2022-06-13 00:28:11	taeaad	So in a quotient category you can collapse commuting squares to equalities. I think they are called sketches.
2022-06-13 00:28:37	pounce	in HoTT nothing "collapses", equalities are just given richer structure... which also causes problems

2022-08-31 07:48:00	brownorange	For the record what convinced me finally it's game over: 1) there are true but unprovable sentences which can refer to G, without having to refer to themself. 2) the fact that any obfuscation of the encoding scheme is yet another function. 3) any minor statement about consistency we can prove from the axioms, is nothing compared to all the others that remain. 4) provability is always about what's provable from the axioms rather than hypothetical
2022-08-31 07:48:00	brownorange	situations. 5) none of the rules of the system let you prove that any true theorem implies something is unprovable.

2022-08-31 07:49:26	Fangs	brownorange: who are you though, what do you do irl etc
2022-08-31 07:49:31	Fangs	why were you interested in this
2022-08-31 07:50:07	brownorange	As a programmer it could be useful to know what the limits of consistency are. IF I discovered a new limit or weird case, that could be useful

2022-08-31 07:50:46	Fangs	brownorange: classical logic is not the only logical system we have
2022-08-31 07:51:01	Fangs	there are constructive logic, i took a course where they talked about modal logic
2022-08-31 07:51:10	Fangs	I think that one can model a lot of the other non-classical logics
2022-08-31 07:51:28	brownorange	do you program with true contradictions?

2022-08-31 07:51:41	Fangs	but theres a funny post
2022-08-31 07:52:01	Fangs	brownorange: https://inutile.club/estatis/falso/
2022-08-31 07:52:33	Fangs	It has come to our attention that several alternative operating systems such as "Linux" include a utility known as "/bin/true" which has been presented as a free, "open source" alternative to our Estatis Falso HyperVerifier program.
2022-08-31 07:52:33	Fangs	Users of these systems should be aware that this pirated software is illegal and infringes on intellectual property belonging to Estatis Inc. Estatis is currently engaged in legal proceedings to enforce its rights and stop the distribution of this unlawful program. Besides, you should know we have identified numerous flaws in "/bin/true" which make it unsuitable for production use and which can lead to grossly incorrect results. (For
2022-08-31 07:52:33	Fangs	instance, "/bin/true" fails to check the well-formedness of its input.)
2022-08-31 07:52:33	Fangs	Open source and pirate programs are a threat to your computers and your mathematical activity. Always use genuine versions of Estatis Inc. products

2022-08-31 07:54:26	brownorange	i came close a few times to embracing Falsum myself.
2022-08-31 07:54:51	brownorange	i would have been able to prove much more

2022-08-31 07:55:45	brownorange	i've actually spent years behind the scenes developing code/tools relying on classical logic assumptions.
2022-08-31 07:56:05	brownorange	i was hoping to make them more powerful by understanding uses of consistency
2022-08-31 07:56:05	Fangs	to what purpose

2022-08-31 08:28:34	brownorange	Fangs, basically you don't allow the consistency of the circuit nor the proposition G to be permitted in the provable set of propositions.
2022-08-31 08:28:34	brownorange	else boom.
2022-08-31 08:28:34	Bike	fmlatghor: guessed. but i can solve it too, of course. what's wrong with -10n < 0? I don't understand "not an option", that's a perfectly normal inequality
2022-08-31 08:28:34	fmlatghor	oh.
2022-08-31 08:28:34	fmlatghor	huh.
2022-08-31 08:28:34	Bike	do you understand how to solve for n?
2022-08-31 08:28:34	fmlatghor	i can divide zero but i cant divide by zero i think
2022-08-31 08:28:34	fmlatghor	i got -10n < 0   now
2022-08-31 08:28:34	Bike	Right, but you don't need to divide by zero. You just need to isolate n, right?
2022-08-31 08:28:34	Bike	So it's actually the -10 you want to get rid of, yeah?
2022-08-31 08:28:34	fmlatghor	so add?
2022-08-31 08:28:34	fmlatghor	add 10?
2022-08-31 08:28:34	brownorange	now it's pretty useless until you think of asserts.
2022-08-31 08:28:34	fmlatghor	to both sides?
2022-08-31 08:28:38	Bike	No, -10 is a coefficient. Adding ten would just get you -10n + 10 < 10

2022-08-31 08:29:22	Bike	yep.
2022-08-31 08:29:35	fmlatghor	divide 0 by -10?

2022-08-31 08:29:58	Bike	yep.
2022-08-31 08:30:22	fmlatghor	and sign gets reversed so n > 0

2022-09-02 05:49:42	alphamule	So just use ratio to get the highest amount you want.  Since e^x has limit of 0 as x -> -infinity, a*times that limit is also 0.
