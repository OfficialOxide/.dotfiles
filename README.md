# Dotfiles

These dotfiles contain my configurations for:
- [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3)
- [vim](https://www.vim.org/)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh)
- [polybar]()https://github.com/polybar/polybar
- [zathura](https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/)
- [terminator](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Terminator)
- [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)
- [weechat](https://weechat.org/)
- [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst)
- [compton](https://github.com/chjj/compton)
plus some miscellaneous scripts and my LaTeX preamble.

All the due credit goes to the people from whom I stole and modified the dotfiles for my own use.
